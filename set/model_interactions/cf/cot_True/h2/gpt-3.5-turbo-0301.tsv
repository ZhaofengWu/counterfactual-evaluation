It has a tweaked rule.)\nIn this version, a GAME-SET is a set of three cards:\n- For each figure attribute except the number (color, shape, fill), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\n- But only for the number attribute, 2 of the cards should have the same number, and 1 of them should have a different number in order for the set to be valid.\n\nHere is the board:\n(2 | red | oval | open) (2 | green | oval | open) (3 | blue | squiggle | open) (2 | green | oval | striped)\n(3 | red | diamond | striped) (1 | blue | squiggle | striped) (3 | green | diamond | striped) (3 | blue | squiggle | striped)\n(2 | blue | oval | open) (1 | blue | squiggle | open) (2 | blue | squiggle | open) (2 | green | squiggle | open)\n\nYou can pick a set by typing the cards in the below format:\nFirst card: CARD1\nSecond card: CARD2\nThird card: CARD3\nNow remember the rule and tell me which three cards here constitutes a GAME-SET in the same format.\nI will give you 2 cards as a hint, and you tell me the third one.\nFirst card: (2 | green | oval | striped)\nSecond card: (3 | red | diamond | striped)\nLet's think step by step.	The first two cards have different numbers, different colors, different shapes, and different fills. So, we need to find a card that satisfies the rule for each attribute except the number, and has a different number than the first two cards.\n\nLet's start with the color attribute. The first card is green, and the second card is red. So, the third card should either be green or red.\n\nNext, let's look at the shape attribute. The first card is oval, and the second card is diamond. So, the third card should either be oval or diamond.\n\nFinally, let's look at the fill attribute. The first card is striped, and the second card is striped. So, the third card should also be striped.\n\nNow, we need to find a card that satisfies all of these conditions and has a different number than the first two cards. Looking at the remaining cards, we see that the only card that fits is:\n\nThird card: (2 | blue | squiggle | striped)\n\nSo, the GAME-SET is:\n(2 | green | oval | striped) (3 | red | diamond | striped) (2 | blue | squiggle | striped)	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The first two cards have different numbers, different colors, different shapes, and different fills. So, we need to find a third card that satisfies the same conditions.\n\nLet's start with the number attribute. The first two cards have different numbers, so the third card should have a number that is different from both of them. We can eliminate all the cards with a number of 2 or 1, leaving us with only the cards with a number of 3.\n\nNow, let's look at the color attribute. The first two cards have different colors, so the third card should have a color that is different from both of them. We can eliminate the cards with the same color as the first two cards, leaving us with only the card with a color of blue.\n\nNext, let's look at the shape attribute. The first two cards have different shapes, so the third card should have a shape that is different from both of them. We can eliminate the cards with the same shape as the first two cards, leaving us with only the card with a shape of squiggle.\n\nFinally, let's look at the fill attribute.

The first card and second card have different numbers, different colors, different shapes, and different fills. So, we need to find a third card that satisfies the rule for each attribute except the number, and has a different number than the first two cards.\n\nLet's start with the color attribute. The first card is green and the second card is blue, so the third card should either be green or blue.\n\nNext, the shape attribute. The first card is a squiggle and the second card is a diamond, so the third card should either be a squiggle or a diamond.\n\nFinally, the fill attribute. The first card is solid and the second card is open, so the third card should either be solid or open.\n\nNow, we need to find a card that satisfies all three of these conditions and has a different number than the first two cards.

The first two cards have different colors, shapes, and fills, so we need to find a third card that either has all the same attributes or all different attributes for each figure attribute except the number.\n\nLet's start with the color attribute. The first card is blue and the second card is green, so we need to find a third card that is either blue or green.\n\nNext, let's look at the shape attribute. The first card is a diamond and the second card is an oval, so we need to find a third card that is either a diamond or an oval.\n\nFinally, let's look at the fill attribute. The first card is open and the second card is solid, so we need to find a third card that is either open or solid.\n\nNow let's look at the remaining cards and see if we can find a card that satisfies all of these conditions.\n\n(1 | red | diamond | solid) - This card has a different color than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(1 | blue | oval | striped) - This card has a different shape than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(3 | green | squiggle | solid) - This card has a different number than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(2 | blue | squiggle | striped) - This card has a different shape than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(3 | blue | oval | striped) - This card has the same color and fill as the first two cards, but a different shape, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(3 | red | diamond | solid) - This card has a different color than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(3 | blue | squiggle | striped) - This card has the same color and shape as the first two cards, but a different fill, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(2 | red | oval | solid) - This card has a different color and shape than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\n(3 | red | squiggle | striped) - This card has a different color and shape than the first two cards, so it's not a valid option.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid third card that can form a GAME-SET with the first two cards.

The first two cards have the same shape and fill, but different colors and numbers. So, we need to find a third card that either has the same color and number as the first card, or the same color and number as the second card, or all different colors and numbers.\n\nLet's go through the cards one by one:\n- (3 | blue | oval | striped): Different shape and fill from the first two cards, so not a valid option.\n- (3 | green | squiggle | solid): Different color from the first card, so not a valid option.\n- (2 | green | oval | striped): Different shape and fill from the first two cards, so not a valid option.\n- (3 | blue | squiggle | solid): Different color from the first card, so not a valid option.\n- (3 | green | oval | solid): Different shape and fill from the first two cards, so not a valid option.\n- (3 | red | diamond | striped): Different shape and fill from the first two cards, so not a valid option.\n- (3 | red | oval | solid): Different shape and fill from the first two cards, so not a valid option.\n- (2 | red | diamond | striped): Different shape and fill from the first two cards, so not a valid option.\n- (2 | green | oval | solid): Same shape and fill as the second card, but different color and number from the first card.

The first two cards have different colors, shapes, and fills, so we need to find a third card that either has all the same attributes or all different attributes for each figure attribute except the number.\n\nLet's start with the color attribute. The first card is red and the second card is blue, so we need to find a third card that is either red or blue. Looking at the board, we see that the fourth card is blue, so it could be a potential candidate.\n\nNext, let's look at the shape attribute. The first card is oval and the second card is diamond, so we need to find a third card that is either oval or diamond. Looking at the board, we see that the eleventh card is diamond, so it could be a potential candidate.\n\nFinally, let's look at the fill attribute. The first card is open and the second card is striped, so we need to find a third card that is either open or striped. Looking at the board, we see that the twelfth card is open, so it could be a potential candidate.\n\nNow we need to check the number attribute. The first card has a number of 1 and the second card has a number of 2, so we need to find a third card that has a number of 3. Looking at the board, we see that the first card has a number of 3, so it could be a potential candidate.\n\nWe have four potential candidates: the fourth card, the eleventh card, the twelfth card, and the first card. Let's check each one to see if it forms a valid set with the first two cards.\n\n(1 | red | oval | open) (2 | blue | diamond | striped) (1 | blue | oval | open) - This set is not valid because the shapes are not all the same or all different.\n\n(1 | red | oval | open) (2 | blue | diamond | striped) (2 | blue | squiggle | open) - This set is not valid because the fills are not all the same or all different.\n\n(1 | red | oval | open) (2 | blue | diamond | striped) (3 | green | squiggle | solid) - This set is valid because the colors are all different, the shapes are all different, the fills are all different, and two of the cards have a number of 2 while the third card has a number of 3.\n\n(1 | red | oval | open) (2 | blue | diamond | striped) (3 | green | squiggle | striped) - This set is not valid because the fills are not all the same or all different.\n\nTherefore, the GAME-SET is:\nFirst card: (1 | red | oval | open)\nSecond card: (2 | blue | diamond | striped)\nThird card: (3 | green | squiggle | solid)	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The first two cards have the same number attribute, but different color and fill attributes. So, the third card should have the same number attribute as well.\nFor the shape attribute, the first two cards have the same shape, but different colors. So, the third card should have a different shape than the first two cards.\nFor the fill attribute, the first two cards have different fills.

It has a tweaked rule.)\nIn this version, a GAME-SET is a set of three cards:\n- For each figure attribute except the number (color, shape, fill), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\n- But only for the number attribute, 2 of the cards should have the same number, and 1 of them should have a different number in order for the set to be valid.\n\nHere is the board:\n(1 | blue | diamond | striped) (1 | green | oval | solid) (2 | green | squiggle | solid) (3 | green | oval | open)\n(2 | green | squiggle | open) (1 | blue | diamond | open) (3 | red | oval | solid) (3 | red | diamond | striped)\n(3 | red | diamond | open) (3 | red | oval | open) (1 | red | diamond | open) (3 | red | squiggle | solid)\n\nYou can pick a set by typing the cards in the below format:\nFirst card: CARD1\nSecond card: CARD2\nThird card: CARD3\nNow remember the rule and tell me which three cards here constitutes a GAME-SET in the same format.\nI will give you 2 cards as a hint, and you tell me the third one.\nFirst card: (1 | blue | diamond | striped)\nSecond card: (3 | green | oval | open)\nLet's think step by step.	The first card and the second card have different colors, shapes, and fills, so we need to find a third card that either has all the same attributes or all different attributes for each figure attribute except the number.\n\nFor the color attribute, the first card is blue and the second card is green, so the third card must be either blue or green.\n\nFor the shape attribute, the first card is a diamond and the second card is an oval, so the third card must be either a diamond or an oval.\n\nFor the fill attribute, the first card is striped and the second card is open, so the third card must be either striped or open.\n\nNow, we need to check the number attribute. The first card has a number of 1 and the second card has a number of 3, so the third card must have a number of 2.\n\nBased on these rules, the only card that fits is:\n(2 | blue | diamond | open)\n\nTherefore, the GAME-SET is:\n(1 | blue | diamond | striped) (3 | green | oval | open) (2 | blue | diamond | open)	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
