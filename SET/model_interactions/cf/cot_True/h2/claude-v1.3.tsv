It has a tweaked rule.)\nIn this version, a GAME-SET is a set of three cards:\n- For each figure attribute except the number (color, shape, fill), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\n- But only for the number attribute, 2 of the cards should have the same number, and 1 of them should have a different number in order for the set to be valid.\n\nHere is the board:\n(3 | blue | squiggle | solid) (1 | red | squiggle | open) (2 | blue | oval | open) (1 | green | oval | solid)\n(3 | blue | oval | striped) (1 | green | diamond | striped) (2 | red | squiggle | open) (2 | green | oval | solid)\n(3 | blue | diamond | open) (3 | blue | squiggle | striped) (1 | red | diamond | open) (2 | green | oval | striped)\n\nYou can pick a set by typing the cards in the below format:\nFirst card: CARD1\nSecond card: CARD2\nThird card: CARD3\nNow remember the rule and tell me which three cards here constitutes a GAME-SET in the same format.\nI will give you 2 cards as a hint, and you tell me the third one.\nFirst card: (1 | green | oval | solid)\nSecond card: (3 | blue | squiggle | striped)\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, I understand the rules. Let me think:\n\nFirst card: (1 | green | oval | solid) \nSecond card: (3 | blue | squiggle | striped)\n\nFor a valid GAME-SET, the attributes (color, shape, fill) should be either all the same or all different across the 3 cards. \nThe numbers can be 2 same and 1 different.\n\nLooking at the first two cards:\n- Color: Different (green vs blue)\n- Shape: Different (oval vs squiggle)\n- Fill: Different (solid vs striped)\n- Number: Different (1 vs 3)\n\nTherefore, for the third card, to make a valid GAME-SET:\n- Color: Should be either green or blue (to make all same or all different)\n- Shape: Should be either oval, squiggle or diamond (to make all same or all different)\n- Fill: Should be either solid, striped or open (to make all same or all different)\n- Number: Should be either 1 or 3 (to make 2 same and 1 different)\n\nBased on this, the third card that will make a valid GAME-SET is:\n\nThird card: (1 | blue | diamond | open)\n\nThe attributes for the set are:\n- Color: All different (green, blue, blue) \n- Shape: All different (oval, squiggle, diamond)\n- Fill: All different (solid, striped, open)\n- Number: 2 same (1, 1) and 1 different (3)\n\nSo this constitutes a valid GAME-SET.

Since the first two cards have different shapes (diamond, oval), the third card should have a different shape as well. The remaining shape is squiggle.\n- The fill attribute should be either all the same or all different. Since the first two cards have the same fill (solid), the third card should also have the solid fill.\n- For the number, 2 cards should have the same number and 1 should have a different number.
