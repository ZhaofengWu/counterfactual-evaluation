It has a tweaked rule.)\nIn this version, a GAME-SET is a set of three cards:\n- For each figure attribute except the number (color, shape, fill), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\n- But only for the number attribute, 2 of the cards should have the same number, and 1 of them should have a different number in order for the set to be valid.\nI will give you three cards from the board, and you will tell me whether this constitutes a GAME-SET.\n\nFirst card: (1 | blue | squiggle | open)\nSecond card: (2 | blue | oval | solid)\nThird card: (1 | blue | diamond | striped)\n\nIs this a GAME-SET?

It has a tweaked rule.)\nIn this version, a GAME-SET is a set of three cards:\n- For each figure attribute except the number (color, shape, fill), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\n- But only for the number attribute, 2 of the cards should have the same number, and 1 of them should have a different number in order for the set to be valid.\nI will give you three cards from the board, and you will tell me whether this constitutes a GAME-SET.\n\nFirst card: (2 | blue | diamond | open)\nSecond card: (1 | red | squiggle | solid)\nThird card: (1 | blue | squiggle | solid)\n\nIs this a GAME-SET? Answer with yes or no in the last line. Let's verify rules for each attribute step-by-step:\n	Color: Two cards have blue and one card has red, so they are all different.

Each card has a figure and a number.\nA figure is a combination of a color, a shape, and a fill.\n\nSet of colors are: red , green , blue .\nSet of shapes are: squiggle , diamond , oval .\nSet of fills are: solid , striped , open .\n\n--THE RULE OF THE GAME--\n(This is not the original SET game. It has a tweaked rule.)\nIn this version, a GAME-SET is a set of three cards:\n- For each figure attribute except the number (color, shape, fill), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\n- But only for the number attribute, 2 of the cards should have the same number, and 1 of them should have a different number in order for the set to be valid.\nI will give you three cards from the board, and you will tell me whether this constitutes a GAME-SET.\n\nFirst card: (3 | green | squiggle | striped)\nSecond card: (2 | blue | diamond | solid)\nThird card: (2 | green | diamond | striped)\n\nIs this a GAME-SET? Answer with yes or no in the last line. Let's verify rules for each attribute step-by-step:\n	Color: The colors are green, blue, and green. They are not all the same, nor all different. Therefore, this attribute does not satisfy the rule.\nShape: The shapes are squiggle, diamond, and diamond. They are not all the same, nor all different. Therefore, this attribute does not satisfy the rule.\nFill: The fills are striped, solid, and striped. They are not all the same, nor all different. Therefore, this attribute does not satisfy the rule.\nNumber: The numbers are 3, 2, and 2. Two of them are the same, and one is different. Therefore, this attribute satisfies the rule.\nOverall, this is not a GAME-SET because the color, shape, and fill attributes do not satisfy the rule. Therefore, the answer is no.
