Each card has a figure and a number.\nA figure is a combination of a color, a shape, and a fill.\n\nSet of colors are: red , green , blue .\nSet of shapes are: squiggle , diamond , oval .\nSet of fills are: solid , striped , open .\n\n--THE RULE OF THE GAME--\nA GAME-SET is set of three cards: For each attribute, (color, shape, fill, number), the three cards should either be ALL the SAME or NONE the SAME (=ALL DIFFERENT, e.g. if 2 of the cards have the same value, and 1 of them has a different value, the set is NOT valid; for example, (blue, green, blue) is MIXED and does not satisfy any of the rule, whereas (oval, diamond, squiggle) is all different.\nI will give you three cards from the board, and you will tell me whether this constitutes a GAME-SET.\n\nFirst card: (1 | blue | squiggle | striped)\nSecond card: (3 | green | squiggle | solid)\nThird card: (1 | green | diamond | open)\n\nIs this a GAME-SET? Answer with yes or no in the last line. Let's verify rules for each attribute step-by-step:\n	Color: The colors are blue, green, and green. They are NOT all the same, and they are NOT all different. Therefore, this attribute does NOT satisfy the rule.\nShape: The shapes are squiggle, squiggle, and diamond. They are NOT all the same, and they are NOT all different. Therefore, this attribute does NOT satisfy the rule.\nFill: The fills are striped, solid, and open. They are NOT all the same, and they are NOT all different. Therefore, this attribute does NOT satisfy the rule.\nNumber: The numbers are 1, 3, and 1. They are NOT all the same, and they are NOT all different. Therefore, this attribute does NOT satisfy the rule.\n\nSince NONE of the attributes satisfy the rule, this is NOT a GAME-SET. The answer is NO.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Answer with yes or no in the last line. Let's verify rules for each attribute step-by-step:\n	Color: Two cards are blue and one is green, so they are NOT all the same. They are also NOT all different. Therefore, this attribute does not satisfy the rule.\nShape: Two cards are diamonds and one is an oval, so they are NOT all the same. They are also NOT all different. Therefore, this attribute does not satisfy the rule.\nFill: One card is open, one is striped, and one is solid, so they are NOT all the same. They are also NOT all different.
