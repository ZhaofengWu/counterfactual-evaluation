Since we are in the middle of the room, we can assume that the room's width and height are both 500 units. We also have the directions defined in the problem statement.\n\nNow, let's place the objects in the room. Since the sink is on the south side, we can assume it is at the bottom of the room. The washing machine is on the east side, so it should be on the right side of the room. The dryer is on the west side, so it should be on the left side of the room.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the room:\n\n```json\n{\n  "name": "laundry_room",\n  "width": 500,\n  "height": 500,\n  "directions": {\n    "north": [0, -1],\n    "south": [1, 0],\n    "east": [-1, 0],\n    "west": [0, 1]\n  },\n  "objects": [\n    {\n      "name": "sink",\n      "x": 250,\n      "y": 450\n    },\n    {\n      "name": "washing_machine",\n      "x": 450,\n      "y": 250\n    },\n    {\n      "name": "dryer",\n      "x": 50,\n      "y": 250\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this representation, we have placed the sink at the bottom center (x: 250, y: 450), the washing machine on the right side (x: 450, y: 250), and the dryer on the left side (x: 50, y: 250).
