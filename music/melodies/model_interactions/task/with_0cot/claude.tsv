You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in C major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody for 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in the key of C major:\n\n1) The song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' is typically sung by young children, so the melody is likely very simple. This suggests the first note is probably the tonic note of C major, which is C.\n\n2) The lyrics of the first line are 'The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout'. The word 'the' is usually not emphasized in a melody, so the first note is likely on either 'itsy' or 'bitsy'. Of these two options, 'itsy' seems slightly more likely to receive emphasis. If so, the first note would be on 'itsy', suggesting it may be C.\n\n3) The rhythm of the first line also supports the first note being on the word 'itsy'. The rhythm is usually 'da da da da da' with the 'da's representing eighth notes. The first 'da' would naturally fall on 'itsy', again suggesting the first note may be C.\n\nBased on this analysis, my best guess is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=C	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in C major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in the key of C major:\n\n1) The song 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' is typically sung by children, so the melody is likely very simple. This suggests the first note is probably the tonic note of C major, which is C.\n\n2) The lyrics of the song's first line are 'London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down'. The repeated 'falling down' suggests a descending melodic pattern. The note just below C is B. \n\n3) However, the interval between C and B is a minor 7th, which is a somewhat large interval for a children's song. The note just below C that is still within the typical range for children is G.\n\n4) The note G is also the dominant note of the C major scale, so starting the melody on the dominant note helps establish the key and leads nicely back to the tonic C note.\n\nIn summary, based on the reasoning above, my best guess for the first note of 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in C major is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=G	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' in the key of F major:\n\n1) The key signature of F major contains one flat, Bb.

Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' in the key of F major:\n\n1) The key signature of F major contains one flat, Bb. So the notes in the F major scale are: F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F.\n\n2) The tonic or home note of the key is F. Since 'Old MacDonald' is a children's song, it is likely to start on the tonic. \n\n3) The first interval of a melody is often a perfect unison, perfect 4th or perfect 5th above the tonic. The notes a perfect 4th and 5th above F are Bb and C respectively. \n\n4) Given the lighthearted, simple nature of the song, a perfect 5th interval seems more likely for the first interval.\n\nANSWER: NOTE=C	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in the key of F major:\n\n1) The song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' is typically sung by young children, so the melody is likely very simple. This suggests the first note is probably the tonic note of the key, which in F major is F.\n\n2) The lyrics of the first line are "The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout". The word "the" is typically not emphasized in a melody, so the first note is likely on either "itsy", "bitsy" or "spider". Of these options, "spider" is a focal word that would likely be emphasized. So the first note may be on the word "spider".\n\n3) If the first note is on the word "spider", the note would likely be the tonic F, the 3rd G or the 5th C. The tonic F is a very common choice for the first note of a children's song.\n\nPutting this together, my best guess is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=F	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' in G major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' in the key of G major:\n\nThe key of G major has one sharp, F sharp. The notes in the G major scale are:\nG, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G\n\nThe first note of a melody is usually the tonic note of the key, which is G. \nHowever, the melody of 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' starts higher in the scale. \nThe first word 'Old' is typically sung higher, around a 5th interval above the tonic.\nThe 5th note of the G major scale is D.\n\nSo based on this reasoning, my best guess for the first note of the melody in G major would be:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=D	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in G major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in the key of G major:\n\n1) The song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' is typically sung by young children, so the melody is likely very simple. This suggests the first note is probably the tonic note of the key, which in G major is G.\n\n2) The lyrics of the first line are "The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout". The word "the" is typically not emphasized in a melody, so the first note is likely on either "itsy", "bitsy" or "spider". Of these options, "spider" is a focal word that would likely be emphasized. So the first note may be on the word "spider".\n\n3) If the first note is on the word "spider", the note would likely be the tonic G based on the reasoning in step 1. \n\nPutting this together, my best guess is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=G	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in the key of G major:\n\n1) The song 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' is in a major key. Without listening to the melody, the most likely first note of the melody would be the tonic note of the key, which in G major is G.\n\n2) However, the melody of children's songs often starts on the 5th scale degree, which in G major is D. The 5th scale degree is a very common note for melodies to start on.\n\n3) Given this, and without more context about the specific melody, my best guess for the first note of 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in G major would be:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=D	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' in A major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm' in the key of A major:\n\nThe key of A major has the notes A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G#.\n\nThe tonic or home note of the key is A.\n\nMelodies often start on the tonic, dominant (E) or subdominant (D) notes.\n\nGiven the simple, familiar nature of 'Old MacDonald Had A Farm', the tonic (A) seems the most likely first note of the melody. \n\nSo my final answer is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=A	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in A major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in the key of A major:\n\n1) The song 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' is typically sung by young children, so the melody is likely very simple. This suggests the first note is probably the tonic note (A), the dominant (E), or the subdominant (D).\n\n2) The lyrics of the first line are "The itsy bitsy spider climbed up the water spout". The word 'climbed' has an upward, ascending feeling which suggests the melody also goes up. This suggests the first note is probably higher than A, so either E or D. \n\n3) The subdominant note (D) would create a sense of stability, whereas the dominant (E) would create a sense of tension that wants to resolve up to A. Since this is the first note of the melody, the subdominant D seems more likely to establish the key of A major.\n\nPutting this together, my best guess for the first note of 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' in A major is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=D	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the melody of the song 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in A major? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my attempt at determining the first note of the melody of 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' in the key of A major:\n\n1) The song 'London Bridge Is Falling Down' is typically sung by children, so the melody is likely very simple. This suggests the first note is probably the tonic note (A), the dominant (E), or the subdominant (D).\n\n2) The first line of lyrics is 'London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down'. The repetition of 'falling down' three times likely corresponds to a descending melodic pattern. So the first note is probably not the tonic (A). \n\n3) The subdominant (D) is below the tonic, so starting on D would fit with a descending pattern. However, the dominant (E) is the most common note to start a melody after the tonic.\n\n4) Based on the above reasoning, the most likely first note of the melody in A major is the dominant, E.\n\nANSWER: NOTE=E	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
