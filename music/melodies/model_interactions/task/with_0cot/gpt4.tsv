However, since the question asks for E# major, we will proceed with that.\n\nThe key of E# major has the following notes: E#, F##, G##, A#, B#, C##, and D##.\n\nNow, let's analyze the melody of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat." The song starts with three consecutive notes of the same pitch, which is the first note of the major scale. In this case, that would be E#.\n\nSo, the first note of the melody of the song 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat' in E# major is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=E#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
