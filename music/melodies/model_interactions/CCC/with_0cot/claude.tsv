You are an expert musician. What is the first note of the Cb major scale? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, here is my step-by-step thinking:\n\n1) To determine the notes in a major scale, we start with the tonic note, which is the note that the scale is named after. In this case, the tonic note is Cb.\n\n2) From the tonic note, we follow the major scale pattern: whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.\n\n3) A whole step is 2 frets on the guitar or 2 keys on the piano. A half step is 1 fret or 1 key.\n\n4) Starting from Cb, we go up a whole step to Db. Then up another whole step to Eb. Then up a half step to Fb. \n\n5) Continuing from Fb, we go up a whole step to Gb, up another whole step to Ab, and up another whole step to Bb. \n\n6) Finally, we go up a half step from Bb back to Cb, which completes the octave.\n\n7) Therefore, the first note of the Cb major scale is:\n\nANSWER: NOTE=Cb	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
