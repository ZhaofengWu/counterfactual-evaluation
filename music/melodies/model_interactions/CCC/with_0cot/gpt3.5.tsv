You are an expert musician. What is the second note of the E# major scale? Make sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: NOTE={note}.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to understand that E# is the same as F. This is because in music theory, each note has a unique name, and there is no such thing as two different notes having the same name. Therefore, E# is enharmonically equivalent to F.\n\nNext, we need to know the formula for the major scale, which is W-W-H-W-W-W-H (where W represents a whole step and H represents a half step).\n\nUsing this formula, we can determine the E# (or F) major scale as follows:\n\nF-G-A-Bb-C-D-E-F\n\nTherefore, the second note of the E# (or F) major scale is ANSWER: NOTE=G.
