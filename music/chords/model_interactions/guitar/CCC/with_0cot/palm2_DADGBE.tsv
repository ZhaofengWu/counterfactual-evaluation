You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard low E string is instead tuned to D. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings D-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.
