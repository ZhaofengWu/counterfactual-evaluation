You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-B-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-B-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nE string: E\nB string: B\nD string: D\nG string: G\n\nNow, let's find the notes for each finger position:\n\nE string: fret 0 - E\nB string: fret 0 - B\nD string: fret 0 - D\nG string: fret 0 - G\nB string: fret 0 - B\nE string: fret 0 - E\n\nANSWER: E-B-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes for each string at the given frets:\n\nE string: fret 1 - The E string is standard, so fret 1 is a half step up from E, which is F.\n\nB string: fret 1 - The B string is standard, so fret 1 is a half step up from B, which is C.\n\nD string: fret 1 - The D string is standard, so fret 1 is a half step up from D, which is D#.\n\nG string: fret 1 - The G string is standard, so fret 1 is a half step up from G, which is G#.\n\nB string: fret 1 - The B string is standard, so fret 1 is a half step up from B, which is C.\n\nE string: fret 1 - The E string is standard, so fret 1 is a half step up from E, which is F.\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings E-B-D-G-B-E:\n\nANSWER: F-C-D#-G#-C-F	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's find the notes for each string at the 2nd fret:\n\nE string (standard): E - F - F# (2nd fret)\nB string (tuned up to B): B - C - C# (2nd fret)\nD string (standard): D - D# - E (2nd fret)\nG string (standard): G - G# - A (2nd fret)\nB string (tuned up to B): B - C - C# (2nd fret)\nE string (standard): E - F - F# (2nd fret)\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings E-B-D-G-B-E:\n\nANSWER: F#-C#-E-A-C#-F#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
