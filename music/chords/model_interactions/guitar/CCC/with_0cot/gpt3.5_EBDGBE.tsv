You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-B-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-B-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes of each string when played open:\n\nE string: E\nB string: B\nD string: D\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNext, we need to determine the notes produced by each finger position:\n\nE string: fret 0 (open) = E\nB string: fret 0 (open) = B\nD string: fret 0 (open) = D\nG string: fret 0 (open) = G\nB string: fret 0 (open) = B\nE string: fret 0 (open) = E\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: E-B-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to determine the notes of each string in this tuning. \n\nStarting with the low E string, we know that it is still tuned to E. \n\nMoving to the B string, we know that it is tuned to B instead of A. \n\nThe D string is still tuned to D. \n\nThe G string is still tuned to G. \n\nThe second B string is still tuned to B. \n\nFinally, the high E string is still tuned to E. \n\nSo the tuning of this guitar is E-B-D-G-B-E. \n\nNow, let's look at the finger positions given: \n\nE string: fret 2 - This corresponds to the note F# \nB string: fret 2 - This corresponds to the note C# \nD string: fret 2 - This corresponds to the note E \nG string: fret 2 - This corresponds to the note A \nB string: fret 2 - This corresponds to the note C# \nE string: fret 2 - This corresponds to the note F# \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: F#-C#-E-A-C#-F#	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
