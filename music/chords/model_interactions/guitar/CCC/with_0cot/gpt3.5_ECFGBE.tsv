You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nF string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-C-F-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes of each string in this tuning:\n\nE string: E\nC string: C\nF string: F\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNow, we can use the given finger positions to determine the notes played on each string:\n\nE string: fret 0 = E\nC string: fret 0 = C\nF string: fret 0 = F\nG string: fret 0 = G\nB string: fret 0 = B\nE string: fret 0 = E\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: E-C-F-G-B-E	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
