You are an expert guitar player. I have a guitar with standard strings E-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the note of each open string:\n\nE string: E\nA string: A\nD string: D\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNext, we need to determine the note for each fret position. Since all the frets are at position 0, we don't need to make any adjustments to the open string notes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: E-A-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to identify the note that each string produces when played open:\n\nE string: E\nA string: A\nD string: D\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNow, we need to add one fret to each string, which corresponds to moving up one half note:\n\nE string: F\nA string: A#\nD string: D#\nG string: G#\nB string: C\nE string: F\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: F-A#-D#-G#-C-F	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to determine what note each string is tuned to in standard tuning:\n\nE string: E\nA string: A\nD string: D\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNext, we need to determine what note each fret corresponds to. We can use the following chart:\n\nFret 0: Open string note\nFret 1: Half step (one note) higher than open string note\nFret 2: Whole step (two notes) higher than open string note\nFret 3: One and a half steps (three notes) higher than open string note\nAnd so on...\n\nUsing this chart, we can determine that each string played at fret 2 corresponds to the following notes:\n\nE string: F#\nA string: B\nD string: E\nG string: A\nB string: D\nE string: F#\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: F#-B-E-A-D-F#	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
