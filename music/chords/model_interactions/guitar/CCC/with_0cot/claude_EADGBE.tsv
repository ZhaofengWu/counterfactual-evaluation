You are an expert guitar player. I have a guitar with standard strings E-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's go through this sequence step by step:\n\nE string: fret 0 = E \nA string: fret 0 = A\nD string: fret 0 = D\nG string: fret 0 = G \nB string: fret 0 = B\nE string: fret 0 = E\n\nSo the notes corresponding to this sequence of finger positions are:\n\nANSWER: E-A-D-G-B-E	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:\n\nE string: fret 1 \n- This is 1 fret above the open E string, so it corresponds to the note F\n\nA string: fret 1\n- This is 1 fret above the open A string, so it corresponds to the note A# (or Bb)\n\nD string: fret 1 \n- This is 1 fret above the open D string, so it corresponds to the note D# (or Eb)\n\nG string: fret 1\n- This is 1 fret above the open G string, so it corresponds to the note G# (or Ab) \n\nB string: fret 1\n- This is 1 fret above the open B string, so it corresponds to the note C \n\nE string: fret 1\n- Again, this is 1 fret above the open E string, so it corresponds to the note F\n\nANSWER: F-A#-D#-G#-C-F	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
