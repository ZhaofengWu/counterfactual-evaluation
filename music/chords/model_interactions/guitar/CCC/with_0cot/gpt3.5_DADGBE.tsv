You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard low E string is instead tuned to D. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings D-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we have the D string open, which is a D note. Then, we have the A string open, which is an A note. Next, we have the D string open again, which is another D note. Moving on to the G string, we have it open, which is a G note. The B string is also open, which is a B note. Finally, the E string is open, which is an E note.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\nANSWER: D-A-D-G-B-E\n- D-A-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we have the D string on fret 1, which is a half note higher than the open D string. This means we are playing an E note on the D string.\n\nNext, we have the A string on fret 1, which is also a half note higher than the open A string. This means we are playing a B note on the A string.\n\nThen, we have the D string on fret 1 again, which is still an E note.\n\nMoving on to the G string on fret 1, which is a half note higher than the open G string. This means we are playing an A note on the G string.\n\nNext, we have the B string on fret 1, which is also a half note higher than the open B string. This means we are playing a C# note on the B string.\n\nFinally, we have the E string on fret 1, which is a half note higher than the open E string. This means we are playing an F# note on the E string.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: E-B-E-A-C#-F#	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to determine the note of each string when played open. Since the low E string is tuned to D, the open strings are:\n\nD-A-D-G-B-E\n\nNext, we need to determine the note produced by each finger position. Using the fretboard diagram and counting up from the open string, we get:\n\nD string: fret 2 = E\nA string: fret 2 = B\nD string: fret 2 = E\nG string: fret 2 = A\nB string: fret 2 = C#\nE string: fret 2 = F#\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: E-B-E-A-C#-F#	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
