You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard low E string is instead tuned to D. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings D-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nD string: D (fret 0)\nA string: A (fret 0)\nD string: D (fret 0)\nG string: G (fret 0)\nB string: B (fret 0)\nE string: E (fret 0)\n\nNow, let's put them together in the order of strings D-A-D-G-B-E:\n\nANSWER: D-A-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes for each string when played open (fret 0):\nD string: D\nA string: A\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNow, let's find the notes for each string when played at fret 1:\nD string: fret 1 - D# (or Eb)\nA string: fret 1 - A# (or Bb)\nG string: fret 1 - G# (or Ab)\nB string: fret 1 - C\nE string: fret 1 - F\n\nANSWER: D#-A#-D#-G#-C-F	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's find the notes for each string at the given frets:\n\nD string: fret 2 - Since the open D string is D, fret 2 would be two half steps up, which is E.\n\nA string: fret 2 - Since the open A string is A, fret 2 would be two half steps up, which is B.\n\nD string: fret 2 - This is the same as the first string, so it's also E.\n\nG string: fret 2 - Since the open G string is G, fret 2 would be two half steps up, which is A.\n\nB string: fret 2 - Since the open B string is B, fret 2 would be two half steps up, which is C#.\n\nE string: fret 2 - Since the open E string is E, fret 2 would be two half steps up, which is F#.\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings D-A-D-G-B-E:\n\nANSWER: E-B-E-A-C#-F#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
