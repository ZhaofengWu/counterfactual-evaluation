You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nF string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-C-F-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nE string: fret 0 - E\nC string: fret 0 - C\nF string: fret 0 - F\nG string: fret 0 - G\nB string: fret 0 - B\nE string: fret 0 - E\n\nNow, let's put them together in the order of strings E-C-F-G-B-E:\n\nANSWER: E-C-F-G-B-E	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's find the notes for each string at the given frets:\n\nE string: fret 2\nThe E string is tuned to E, so at fret 2, it is F# (E + 2 half steps).\n\nC string: fret 2\nThe C string is tuned to C, so at fret 2, it is D (C + 2 half steps).\n\nF string: fret 2\nThe F string is tuned to F, so at fret 2, it is G (F + 2 half steps).\n\nG string: fret 2\nThe G string is tuned to G, so at fret 2, it is A (G + 2 half steps).\n\nB string: fret 2\nThe B string is tuned to B, so at fret 2, it is C# (B + 2 half steps).\n\nE string: fret 2\nThe E string is tuned to E, so at fret 2, it is F# (E + 2 half steps).\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings E-C-F-G-B-E:\n\nANSWER: F#-D-G-A-C#-F#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
