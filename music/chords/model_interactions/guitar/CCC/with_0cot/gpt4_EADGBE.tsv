You are an expert guitar player. I have a guitar with standard strings E-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-A-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nE string (fret 0): E\nA string (fret 0): A\nD string (fret 0): D\nG string (fret 0): G\nB string (fret 0): B\nE string (fret 0): E\n\nSince all the strings are played open (fret 0), the notes will be the same as the string names.\n\nANSWER: E-A-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
