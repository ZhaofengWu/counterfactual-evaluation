You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings E-C-D-G-B-E.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes of each string in this tuning:\n\nE string: E\nC string: C\nD string: D\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nNow, we can use this information to determine the notes for the given finger positions:\n\nE string: fret 0 - E\nC string: fret 0 - C\nD string: fret 0 - D\nG string: fret 0 - G\nB string: fret 0 - B\nE string: fret 0 - E\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: E-C-D-G-B-E	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to determine the notes of each string in this tuning. \n\nStarting from the thickest string (E), the tuning is: E, C, D, G, B, E. \n\nNow, let's look at the finger positions given: \n\nE string: fret 1 - This corresponds to an F note. \nC string: fret 1 - This corresponds to a C# note (since the C string is tuned to C instead of A). \nD string: fret 1 - This corresponds to a D# note. \nG string: fret 1 - This corresponds to a G# note. \nB string: fret 1 - This corresponds to a C# note. \nE string: fret 1 - This corresponds to an F note (the same as the first string). \n\nPutting it all together, the answer is: \n\nANSWER: F-C#-D#-G#-C#-F	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
