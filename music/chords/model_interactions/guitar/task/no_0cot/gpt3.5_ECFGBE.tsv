We don't need to play anything on the G string since there is no D note on this string. On the B string, we can find the note F# on the 3rd fret. Finally, we don't need to play anything on the thinnest string (E) since there is no D note on this string. \n\nPutting it all together, we get the following frets: \n\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret 2\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
