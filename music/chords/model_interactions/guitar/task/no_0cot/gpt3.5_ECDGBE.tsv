ANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 3\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret X\n\nTo play the A major triad on this guitar, we need to play the notes A, C#, and E. Since the A string is tuned to C, we cannot use it to play the A note. Instead, we can use the C string at the third fret to play the A note. The E string at the second fret can be used to play the C# note, and the B string at the first fret can be used to play the E note. The other strings are not used in this chord.

ANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 2\nD string: fret 4\nG string: fret 6\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X\n\nTo play a D major triad on this guitar, you would need to play the notes D, F#, and A. Since the A string is tuned to C, we need to adjust our fingerings accordingly. Here's how to play the D major triad:\n\n- Place your finger on the 4th fret of the D string to play the note D.\n- Place your finger on the 6th fret of the G string to play the note F#.\n- Place your finger on the 2nd fret of the C string to play the note A (which is the same as the standard guitar's 5th fret on the E string).\n\nBy playing these three notes together, you'll create a D major triad on your special guitar.
