You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the A dominant seventh chord (dom7) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an A dominant seventh chord. It consists of the notes A, C#, E, and G.\n\nNext, let's find those notes on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. The A note is located on the C string, which is tuned to C instead of A. The C# note is located on the D string, the E note is located on the G string, and the G note is located on the B string. \n\nNow, we need to figure out which frets to play these notes on. To play an A note on the C string, we need to play the 3rd fret. To play a C# note on the D string, we need to play the 4th fret. To play an E note on the G string, we need to play the 2nd fret. And to play a G note on the B string, we need to play the 3rd fret.\n\nPutting it all together, the A dominant seventh chord on this guitar would be played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 3\nD string: fret 4\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to determine the note A on this guitar. Since the A string is tuned to C, we need to find the A note on the D string, which is two frets higher than the C note on the same string. Therefore, the A note on this guitar is on the 3rd fret of the D string.\n\nNext, we need to find the note that is a fifth above A, which is E. We can find the E note on the E string, which is already tuned to E. Therefore, we don't need to change anything on the E string.\n\nNow, we need to find the fret on the C string that corresponds to the note E. We can use the same fret position as the E string, which is the 5th fret.\n\nFinally, we need to find the fret positions for the remaining strings. We can use the same fret positions as the standard tuning, which are:\n\nD string: 7th fret\nG string: 2nd fret\nB string: 8th fret\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 5\nD string: fret 7\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 8\nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to find the note Eb on this guitar. \n\nSince the A string is tuned to C, we can use that as our reference point. \n\nTo find Eb, we need to go down a perfect fifth from A. \n\nUsing the E-C-D-G-B-E tuning, we can count down five notes from C: C-Bb-Ab-Eb. \n\nSo, the note Eb can be played on the 4th fret of the G string. \n\nNow, we need to find the note that is a fifth above Eb. \n\nTo do this, we can count up five notes from Eb: Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb. \n\nSo, the note that is a fifth above Eb is Bb. \n\nTo play the Eb fifth interval on this guitar, we can play the following: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret X \nC string: fret 8 \nD string: fret X \nG string: fret 4 \nB string: fret 6 \nE string: fret X \n\nWe are not playing the E and D strings, as they do not contain the notes we need. \n\nOn the C string, we are playing the note Bb on the 8th fret. \n\nOn the G string, we are playing the note Eb on the 4th fret. \n\nOn the B string, we are playing the note F on the 6th fret, which is the same as the note Eb, but one octave higher. \n\nTogether, these notes create the Eb fifth interval.

Since the A string is tuned to C, we need to adjust the location of the Bb note. The B string is still tuned to B, so we can use that string instead. The B note can be found on the 4th fret of the G string, so we need to move up one fret to get to Bb.

First, let's identify the notes in an Ab minor seventh chord: Ab, Cb (or B), Eb, and Gb.\n\nNext, let's find those notes on our guitar with the non-standard tuning:\n\n- Ab: We don't have an A string, but we do have a C string tuned to the same pitch as the A string in standard tuning. So we'll play the C string open to get an Ab note.\n- Cb/B: We don't have a B string, but we do have a G string tuned to the same pitch as the B string in standard tuning. So we'll play the G string at the 4th fret to get a Cb (or B) note.\n- Eb: We have an E string tuned to the same pitch as the standard E string, so we'll play that at the 6th fret to get an Eb note.\n- Gb: We have a G string tuned to the same pitch as the standard G string, so we'll play that open to get a Gb note.\n\nNow we have all the notes we need for an Ab minor seventh chord, but we need to figure out how to play them all at once. Here's one possible way:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 6\nC string: fret 0\nD string: fret 4\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret 6\n\nThis is a barre chord shape that starts on the 6th fret and uses the index finger to hold down all the strings at that fret. The other fingers are used to fret the notes on the D, B, and E strings. It might take some practice to get all the notes to ring out clearly, but with some persistence you should be able to play an Ab minor seventh chord on this non-standard guitar tuning.

Since the A string is tuned to C, we can use that string to play the C# note. We need to find the fret on the C string that produces the same note as the 4th fret on the A string in standard tuning. The 4th fret on the A string in standard tuning produces the note D. To get to C#, we need to lower the pitch by one half step. Therefore, we need to play the 3rd fret on the C string.\n\nStep 3: Locate the A note on the guitar. We can use the E string to play the A note. We need to find the fret on the E string that produces the same note as the 5th fret on the A string in standard tuning. The 5th fret on the A string in standard tuning produces the note E. To get to A, we need to lower the pitch by five half steps. Therefore, we need to play the open E string.\n\nStep 4: Locate the E note on the guitar. We can use the B string to play the E note. We need to find the fret on the B string that produces the same note as the 5th fret on the E string in standard tuning. The 5th fret on the E string in standard tuning produces the note A. To get to E, we need to raise the pitch by five half steps. Therefore, we need to play the 10th fret on the B string.\n\nTherefore, the A major triad on this guitar would be played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 3\nD string: fret X\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 10\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in an Eb diminished seventh chord: Eb, Gb, A, and Cb (or B). \n\nOn our guitar with non-standard tuning, we need to find these notes on the corresponding strings. \n\n- The E string is still tuned to E, so we can play an Eb note by fretting the first fret. \n- The C string is tuned to C instead of A, so we need to find a Cb note. We can do this by fretting the third fret, which is a C note, and then lowering it by one half step. Therefore, we need to fret the second fret on the C string to play a Cb note. \n- The D string is still tuned to D, so we can play a Gb note by fretting the fourth fret. \n- The G string is still tuned to G, so we can play an A note by fretting the second fret. \n- The B string is still tuned to B, so we can play a Cb (or B) note by fretting the first fret. \n- The E string is still tuned to E, so we can play a Gb note by fretting the fourth fret. \n\nPutting it all together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 1\nC string: fret 2\nD string: fret 4\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 4	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to determine the notes of the F fifth interval. The F note is located on the first fret of the E string in standard tuning. The fifth interval of F is C, which is located on the third fret of the A string in standard tuning. However, in this special tuning, the A string is tuned to C, so we can play the C note on the open C string.\n\nNow, we need to find the corresponding frets on the other strings. We can use the following chart to help us:\n\nE string:  F  F# G  G# A  A# B  C  C# D  D# E\nC string:  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B  C\nD string:  G# A  A# B  C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G\nG string:  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B  C  C# D\nB string:  A# B  C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A\nE string:  F# G  G# A  A# B  C  C# D  D# E  F\n\nUsing this chart, we can see that the F note on the E string corresponds to the eighth fret. The C note on the C string is already in the correct position. The F note on the D string corresponds to the third fret. The C note on the G string corresponds to the fifth fret. The A note on the B string corresponds to the third fret. Finally, the F note on the E string corresponds to the first fret.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 1\nC string: open\nD string: fret 3\nG string: fret 5\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret 8	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
