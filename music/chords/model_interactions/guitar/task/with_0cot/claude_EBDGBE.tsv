Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) The A major triad consists of the notes A, C#, and E.\n2) On a standard guitar, you would play:\nE string: fret 2  (A note)\nA string: fret 4  (E note) \nD string: fret 2  (C# note)\n\n3) However, on this special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead. So we cannot play the E note on the A string, fret 4.\n4) The E note is the next higher note in the A major triad. To play the E note, we need to go up two frets from the A note.\n5) The A note is played on the E string, fret 2. Two frets up from fret 2 is fret 4.\n\nTherefore, the A major triad on this special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 4  \nB string: fret X\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret 2	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) The A suspended second chord (Asus2) contains the notes A, B and E.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the D string (to play a B note), the 2nd fret of the G string (to play an E note), and leaving the other strings open (to play A notes).\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead of A. So we can leave that string open to play the B note.\n4) The other notes, E and A, can be played the same as a standard guitar, by fretting the 2nd frets of the D and G strings.\n\nPutting this together, the Asus2 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0 \nB string: fret 0\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to adjust. \n4) The A note is a whole step higher than the G note. So to play an A note on your special guitar, we need to fret the B string two frets higher than the G string.\n5) Therefore, the F dominant seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 1  \nB string: fret 5  \nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret 1	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1) A D fifth interval consists of the notes D and A.\n2) On a standard guitar, you would play the open D string and the A string at the 2nd fret.\n3) However, on this guitar the A string is tuned to B instead. So we can't play the A note on the 2nd fret of that string.\n4) The next closest note to A is G#, which is one fret lower than A. \n5) Therefore, to play a D fifth interval on this guitar, we need to play:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: X  \nB string: X\nD string: 0 \nG string: 2\nB string: X\nE string: X\n\nSo the open D string for the D note, and the G string at the 2nd fret for the G# (closest to A) note.\n\nDoes this make sense?

This gives the notes A, C#, and E.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead of A. So we cannot play the A note on the open A string. \n4) However, we can still play the C# note on the 2nd fret of the G string, and the E note on the 2nd fret of the B string.\n5) To get the A note, we need to play the 3rd fret of the E string, which is tuned to A.\n\nPutting this together, the A sixth chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: 3 \nB string: X\nD string: X \nG string: 2\nB string: 2\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An A augmented seventh chord contains the notes A, C#, E and G#.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\nE string: fret 5  (A)\nA string: fret 6  (C#)\nD string: fret 2  (E) \nG string: fret 4 (G#)\nB string: fret X  (not played)\nE string: fret X  (not played)\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead of A. So we cannot play the C# on that string.\n4) The only other place we can play a C# is on the B string, fret 1.\n5) The E and G# notes can still be played on the D and G strings, same as a standard guitar.\n\nTherefore, the A augmented seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X  \nB string: fret 1  \nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 4\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) An A suspended fourth chord (Asus4) contains the notes A, D and E.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by holding down the 2nd fret on the D, G and B strings. This gives you the notes A, D and E.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead. So we can't play the A note on the 2nd fret of the A string.\n4) However, we can still play the D and E notes on the 2nd frets of the D and G strings, just like on a standard guitar.\n5) To get the A note, we need to play the open E string, which is tuned to E.\n\nPutting this together, the Asus4 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0 \nB string: fret X\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X\n\nSo you would play the open E string, the 2nd fret on the D string, and the 2nd fret on the G string.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The Gb fifth interval is 7 semitones (or frets) above the root note.\n2) On a standard guitar, the Gb note is found on the 3rd fret of the E string.\n3) However, on this special guitar, the E string is tuned to E, and the A string is tuned to B. So the Gb note will not be on the 3rd fret of the E string.\n4) The B note (which the A string is tuned to) is 2 semitones above the G note. \n5) Therefore, to get a Gb note which is 7 semitones above the B note, we need to move up 7 - 2 = 5 frets from the B note.\n6) The B note is the open B string. 5 frets up from the open B string is the 5th fret.\n\nANSWER:\nE string: X \nB string: 0\nD string: X\nG string: X\nB string: 5\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we cannot play the F# note on the 2nd fret of the A string. \n4) Instead, we need to play the F# note on a different string. The next lower string is the G string. Fretting the 2nd fret of the G string would produce an F# note.\n5) Therefore, the Esus2 chord on your special guitar can be played by:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nB string: fret 2\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we cannot play a Db note on the 3rd fret of that string.\n4) We need to find another way to play a Db and Ab note. A Db note can be played on the D string at the 5th fret. An Ab note can be played on the G string at the 1st fret.\n\nPutting this together, here is the answer:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: X  \nB string: X\nD string: 5\nG string: 1\nB string: X\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the F minor seventh chord (min7) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an F minor seventh chord are: F, Ab, C, Eb.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played as:\nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret 3 \nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret 1\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead. So the Ab note needs to be played on the B string instead of the A string.\n4) Therefore, the F minor seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 1  \nB string: fret 3  \nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 3 \nE string: fret 1	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Eb suspended fourth chord (sus4) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An Eb suspended fourth chord contains the notes Eb, Ab and Bb.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played as:\nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret 3\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 0 \nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead. So we need to adjust for this.\n4) The note Ab (fret 3 on the A string of a standard guitar) is a whole step lower than B. So on your guitar, we need to fret the B string one fret lower, at fret 2, to get an Ab.\n5) The notes Eb and Bb are the same as a standard guitar, so we keep the E string at fret 1 and the D string at fret 2.\n\nPutting this together, the Eb suspended fourth chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 1  \nB string: fret 2\nD string: fret 2  \nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) The D suspended second chord (Dsus2) contains the notes D, E, and A.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the G string (A note), the 2nd fret of the E string (E note), and playing the open D string (D note). The other strings are not played.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead. So we cannot play the A note on the 2nd fret of the G string.\n4) However, the open B string on your guitar produces a B note, which is a whole step above A. So we can use the open B string instead to play the A note needed for the Dsus2 chord.\n\nPutting this together, the Dsus2 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 2  \nB string: fret 0 \nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret X\n\nSo you would play the 2nd fret of the E string (E note), the open B string (A note), and the open D string (D note). The other strings are not played.\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the E diminished seventh chord (dim7) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An E diminished seventh chord contains the notes E, G, Bb, and Db.\n\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\nE string: fret 0  (E)\nA string: fret 3  (G)\nD string: fret 1  (Bb)\nG string: fret 2 (Db)\nB string: fret X  (not played)\nE string: fret 0  (E)\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead. So we need to find alternate frets to play the G, Bb, and Db notes.\n\n4) The G note can be played on the B string at the 5th fret (each fret is a half step, so fret 5 is a whole step above the open B string).\n\n5) The Bb note can be played on the D string at the 1st fret (same as a standard guitar)\n\n6) The Db note can be played on the G string at the 3rd fret (two frets higher than the standard guitar, to account for the lower tuning of the B string)\n\nPutting this together, the E diminished seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0  \nB string: fret 5\nD string: fret 1\nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret X  \nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we can't play the Bb note on the A string.\n4) The Bb note is a whole step below the B note. A whole step below the open B string would be the E string, fret 1.\n5) Therefore, to play a G minor triad on this guitar, we would play:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 1  \nB string: fret 0  \nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 3	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An A dominant 7th chord contains the notes A, C#, E and G.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\nE string: fret 5  (A note)\nA string: fret 6  (C# note) \nD string: fret 7 (E note)\nG string: fret 7 (G note)\nB string: fret X (not played)\nE string: fret X (not played)\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to B instead of A. So we cannot play the C# note on that string.\n4) The closest alternative is to play the C# note on the D string instead, at the 8th fret.\n\nTherefore, the A dominant 7th chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 5  \nB string: fret X\nD string: fret 8\nG string: fret 7\nB string: fret X \nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The C fifth interval consists of the notes C and G.\n2) On a standard guitar, the C note can be played on the first fret of the B string, and the G note can be played on the third fret of the E string.\n3) However, on this special guitar, the B string is actually tuned to B, not A. So playing the first fret of the B string would produce a B note, not C. \n4) Therefore, to play a C note, we need to play the third fret of the B string, since each fret increases the pitch by a half step.\n5) The G note can still be played on the third fret of the E string, since the tuning of the E, D and G strings is unchanged.\n\nPutting this together, the C fifth interval on this special guitar can be played as:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 3  \nB string: fret 3\nD string: fret X\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
