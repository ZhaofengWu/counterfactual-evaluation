Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to know the notes in an E sixth chord. An E sixth chord consists of the notes E, G#, B, and C#. \n\nNext, we need to figure out which strings on the guitar correspond to these notes. \n\n- The E string is already tuned to E, so we don't need to change anything there. \n- The C string is tuned to C instead of A, so we need to find the note G# on this string. We can do this by counting up 4 frets from the open string, which gives us the note E. Then, we can count up another 4 frets from E to get G#. Therefore, we need to play the C string on the 4th fret. \n- The F string is tuned to F instead of D, so we need to find the note B on this string. We can do this by counting up 7 frets from the open string, which gives us the note F#. Then, we can count up another 2 frets from F# to get B. Therefore, we need to play the F string on the 9th fret. \n- The G string is already tuned to G, so we don't need to change anything there. \n- The B string is already tuned to B, so we don't need to change anything there. \n- The E string is already tuned to E, so we don't need to change anything there. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 4 \nF string: fret 9 \nG string: fret 0 \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in an A minor seventh chord: A, C, E, G.\n\nOn this guitar, the A note is played on the C string (remember, the standard A string is tuned to C). So we need to find the fret on the C string that plays an A note.\n\nTo do this, we can use a guitar chord finder tool or reference a guitar chord chart. We find that the A note can be played on the 3rd fret of the C string.\n\nNext, we need to find the other notes in the chord. The C note is played on the open E string (remember, the standard E string is tuned to C). The E note is played on the 2nd fret of the G string. The G note is played on the 2nd fret of the B string.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Ab is two half steps below B, which is the last string on the guitar. So, we need to find the note B on the G string, which is tuned to G in this tuning. \n\nTo play B on the G string, we need to play fret 4. So, to play Ab, we need to play two frets lower, which is fret 2 on the G string.\n\nNow, we need to find the note that is a fifth above Ab. A fifth above Ab is Eb. To play Eb, we need to find the note that is two strings higher than the G string, which is the B string. \n\nTo play B on the B string, we need to play fret 4. So, to play Eb, we need to play four frets lower, which is fret 0 on the B string.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret X\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in a G augmented seventh chord: G, B, D#, and F#. \n\nNext, let's figure out where these notes are on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\n- G: This note is already on the G string, so we don't need to do anything there. \n- B: This note is on the E string, but we need to find it on our non-standard tuning. The standard B string is now tuned to E, so we can play the B note on the E string at the 7th fret. \n- D#: This note is not on any of our open strings or the standard tuning notes, so we'll need to find it by using the notes we do have. One way to do this is to use the F string, which is now tuned to D#. We can play this note on the 6th fret of the F string. \n- F#: This note is on the non-standard tuning of the E string, which is now tuned to B. We can play this note on the 4th fret of the E string. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 4 \nC string: fret X \nF string: fret 6 \nG string: fret X \nB string: fret 3 \nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since the standard G string is still tuned to G, we can play the open G string to get the note G.\n\nNext, we need to find the note that is a fifth above G. A fifth above G is D, but on this guitar, the standard D string is tuned to F. So, we need to find the note that is a fifth above F.\n\nA fifth above F is C. Luckily, the standard A string is tuned to C on this guitar. So, we can play the open A string to get the note C.\n\nNow, we need to play the G fifth interval. To do this, we need to play the note G and the note C at the same time. We can do this by playing the following:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret X\n\nThis will play the notes G and C together, creating a G fifth interval.

The D note can be played on the fifth string (G string) at fret 5. \n\nTo play the E minor seventh chord on this guitar, we can play the following: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret X \nF string: fret 3 \nG string: fret 5 \nB string: fret 7 \nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the E fifth interval on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to find the E note on the guitar. Since the tuning is different, we cannot rely on the standard E string. Instead, we can use the B string, which is still tuned to the standard E note.\n\nTo play the E fifth interval, we need to find the note that is seven half-steps above E. This note is B. We can play the B note on the G string, which is still tuned to the standard G note.\n\nNow, we need to find the frets on each string that will produce the E and B notes respectively.\n\n- E string: fret X (not played)\n- C string: fret 8 (produces E note)\n- F string: fret X (not played)\n- G string: fret 4 (produces B note)\n- B string: fret 2 (produces B note)\n- E string: fret X (not played)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 8\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 4\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an Ab minor seventh chord: Ab, Cb (or B), Eb, and Gb.\n\nNext, let's find those notes on our guitar with the non-standard tuning:\n\n- Ab: We don't have an A string, but we do have a C string tuned to the same pitch as the A string in standard tuning. So we'll play the C string open to get an Ab note.\n- Cb/B: We don't have a B string, but we do have an E string tuned to the same pitch as the B string in standard tuning. We'll need to lower the pitch of the E string by two frets to get a Cb (which is the same as a B note lowered by one half-step). So we'll play the E string on the second fret to get a Cb note.\n- Eb: We don't need to do anything special for this note, as it's already on the F string in our non-standard tuning. We'll play the F string open to get an Eb note.\n- Gb: This note is already on the G string in our non-standard tuning. We'll play the G string on the second fret to get a Gb note.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 2\nC string: fret 0\nF string: fret 0\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret 4	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in a D sixth chord: D, F#, A, and B. \n\nOn this guitar, the D note can be played on the G string at fret 5. \n\nThe F# note is not available on any of the strings, so we will have to use a substitute note. One option is to use the A string tuned to C, which is a half step lower than F#. We can play this note at fret 4. \n\nThe A note can be played on the E string at fret 5. \n\nFinally, the B note can be played on the B string at fret 7. \n\nPutting it all together, the D sixth chord on this guitar can be played as follows: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 5 \nC string: fret 4 \nF string: fret X \nG string: fret 5 \nB string: fret 7 \nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Bb suspended fourth chord (sus4) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a Bb sus4 chord. It consists of the notes Bb, Eb, and F.\n\nNext, let's find those notes on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\n- Bb can be found on the 6th string (E string) at fret 6.\n- Eb can be found on the 3rd string (F string) at fret 8.\n- F can be found on the 4th string (G string) at fret 5.\n\nNow, we need to figure out which fingers to use to play these notes and where to place them on the frets. Here's one possible way to play the Bb sus4 chord on this guitar:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 6 (index finger)\nC string: fret X\nF string: fret 8 (ring finger)\nG string: fret 5 (middle finger)\nB string: fret 6 (pinky finger)\nE string: fret 6 (index finger)\n\nNote that we're not using the C string in this chord, so we don't need to worry about it. We're using our index finger to play the Bb note on the 6th string, our ring finger to play the F note on the 3rd string, our middle finger to play the G note on the 4th string, and our pinky finger to play the Bb note on the 2nd string. We're also playing the 6th string and 1st string open to get the E notes.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in an Eb diminished seventh chord: Eb, Gb, A, and Cb (or B). \n\nOn our special guitar, we need to find these notes on the E-C-F-G-B-E tuning. \n\n- Eb: We don't have an Eb note on any open string, so we need to find it on a fret. The closest note we have is E on the 6th string (E string) at fret 11. We can lower this note by two frets to get Eb at fret 9. \n- Gb: We don't have a Gb note on any open string either. The closest note we have is F on the 3rd string (F string) at fret 1. We can raise this note by one fret to get Gb at fret 2. \n- A: We don't have an A note on our tuning, but we do have C on the 2nd string (C string) at fret 1. We can raise this note by five frets to get A at fret 6. \n- Cb/B: We don't have a Cb note on our tuning, but we do have B on the 5th string (B string) at fret 2. We can lower this note by one fret to get Cb at fret 1. \n\nNow that we have identified the notes in the chord and where to find them on our tuning, we can put them together to form the Eb diminished seventh chord: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 9 \nC string: fret 6 \nF string: fret 2 \nG string: fret X \nB string: fret 1 \nE string: fret X \n\nSo to play the Eb diminished seventh chord on this special guitar, we would play the 6th string at fret 9, the 2nd string at fret 1, the 3rd string at fret 2, and the 5th string at fret 1. We would not play the 4th and 1st strings.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The notes are Bb, Db, and F.\n\nNext, we need to find where these notes are located on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\n- Bb is not on any open string, so we will need to fret it somewhere. \n- Db is the same as C#, which is on the C string. \n- F is the same as the F string, so we don't need to do anything special for this note.\n\nTo play the Bb note, we can fret the A string at the first fret, which is now tuned to C. This gives us a C note, which is one half-step above Bb. To get to Bb, we need to move down one fret, so we will fret the A string at the second fret.\n\nNow we have all three notes: Bb on the A string at the second fret, Db on the C string at the fourth fret, and F on the F string at the first fret.\n\nPutting it all together, the Bb minor triad on this guitar would be played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 4\nF string: fret 1\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret 2	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in a D major triad: D, F#, A.\n\nSince the tuning of the guitar is different, we need to find these notes on the new tuning. \n\n- The D note is not on any of the strings, so we need to find a way to play it. One option is to use the 5th fret on the A string, which is now tuned to C. This will give us a D note.\n- The F# note is now on the new tuning's G string, which is tuned to F. We can play it on the 4th fret of the G string.\n- The A note is still on the B string, so we can play it on the 2nd fret of the B string.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret X\nF string: fret 4\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The closest note we have is an A on our 5th fret of the E string. We can lower this note by one half step by fretting the 6th fret of the E string. This gives us a Bb note. \n- D: We have a D note on our open G string, so we don't need to fret anything for this note. \n- F: We have an F note on our open C string, so we don't need to fret anything for this note. \n- G: We have a G note on our open G string, so we don't need to fret anything for this note. \n\nNow that we know where each note is, we can figure out which frets to play to form a Bb sixth chord. \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 6 \nC string: fret 0 \nF string: fret 5 \nG string: fret 0 \nB string: fret 6 \nE string: fret 6 \n\nTo play a Bb sixth chord on this guitar, we would need to fret the 6th fret of the E string, the 5th fret of the F string, and the 6th fret of the B string.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a D minor seventh chord: D, F, A, and C.\n\nOn this guitar, the notes on each string are:\n\nE string: E\nC string: C\nF string: F\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nTo play a D note, we can either play the open D string (which is tuned to C on this guitar) or play the fifth fret on the A string (which is tuned to C# on a standard guitar). Since we don't have a C# note on this guitar, we'll use the open D string.\n\nTo play an F note, we can play the third fret on the F string (which is tuned to F on this guitar).\n\nTo play an A note, we can play the fifth fret on the C string (which is tuned to A on a standard guitar).\n\nTo play a C note, we can play the third fret on the G string (which is tuned to C on a standard guitar).\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 5\nF string: fret 3\nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret 6\nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

A Db sixth chord consists of the notes Db, F, Ab, and Bb.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how to play these notes on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\n- The E string is tuned to E, so we cannot use it to play any of the notes in the Db sixth chord.\n- The C string is tuned to C, which is a whole step lower than the standard A string. To play a Db note, we need to fret the C string at the 2nd fret. \n- The F string is tuned to F, which is a whole step lower than the standard D string. To play an Ab note, we need to fret the F string at the 3rd fret. \n- The G string is tuned to G, which is the same as the standard G string. To play an F note, we need to fret the G string at the 1st fret. \n- The B string is tuned to B, which is the same as the standard B string. To play a Bb note, we need to fret the B string at the 1st fret. \n- The E string is tuned to E, which is the same as the standard E string.

In this tuning, the standard D string is tuned to F, so we cannot use it to play the D fifth interval. However, the standard A string is tuned to C, which is a perfect fourth above F. Therefore, we can use the A string to play the D fifth interval by playing it two frets higher than the F note on the F string.\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret X\nF string: fret 3\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nA string: fret 5	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to find the note Db on this tuning. \n\nDb is two half steps down from D, which is on the G string at fret 3 in standard tuning. In this tuning, the G string is tuned to F, so we need to move down two frets from fret 3 to find F# (which is two half steps up from E). Then, we need to move down one more fret to find F, and then down one more fret to find E#. However, E# is the same as F, so we can just play fret 0 on the E string to get the note F/Db.\n\nNow, we need to find the fifth interval above Db/F. \n\nThe fifth interval above Db is Ab. In standard tuning, this would be played on the D string at fret 4. However, in this tuning, the D string is tuned to F, so we need to find Ab on the C string instead. Ab is four half steps up from F, so we need to play fret 4 on the C string to get the note Ab.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 4\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret 1	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an A augmented seventh chord: A, C#, E, G#. \n\nSince our guitar is tuned differently, we need to find the corresponding frets for these notes on our strings. \n\n- A is not in our tuning, so we'll need to use a different note as the root. Let's use C# instead, which is on the 4th fret of the C string. \n- C# is not in the tuning either, but we can use the same fret on the E string to get the same note. \n- E is on the 9th fret of the F string. \n- G# is not in the tuning, but we can use the same fret on the B string to get the same note. \n\nNow we have the notes we need, but we need to arrange them in the correct order and add the seventh. \n\n- C# on the 4th fret of the C string \n- E on the 9th fret of the F string \n- G# on the 4th fret of the B string \n- B on the 7th fret of the E string \n\nThis gives us the notes C#, E, G#, and B, which is the A augmented seventh chord. \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 7 \nC string: fret 4 \nF string: fret X \nG string: fret 4 \nB string: fret 4 \nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an A sixth chord: A, C#, E, and F#. \n\nOn this guitar, the A note is played on the C string (remember, the A string is tuned to C). \n\nTo play the C# note, we can use the G string, which is still tuned to G. We need to find the note C# on the G string, which is two frets up from the open string. So we play the G string on fret 2. \n\nFor the E note, we can use the B string, which is still tuned to B. We need to find the note E on the B string, which is two frets up from the open string. So we play the B string on fret 2. \n\nFinally, for the F# note, we can use the E string, which is still tuned to E. We need to find the note F# on the E string, which is four frets up from the open string. So we play the E string on fret 4. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 4\nC string: fret 0\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Ab major triad on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to know the notes in the Ab major triad. The Ab major triad consists of the notes Ab, C, and Eb.\n\nNext, we need to find where these notes are located on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\nThe C string is already tuned to C, so we can use it to play the C note in the Ab major triad. \n\nThe F string is already tuned to F, so we can use it to play the Ab note in the Ab major triad. \n\nThe G string is still tuned to G, so we need to find a way to play the Eb note on this string. We can do this by playing the note two frets up from the third fret, which is the same as playing the fifth fret on a standard guitar. \n\nNow we have the following:\n\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret X\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret 5\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X\n\nTo complete the Ab major triad, we need to find a way to play the note C on the E string and the note Eb on the B string. \n\nWe can play the C note on the E string by playing the note on the eighth fret, which is the same as playing the third fret on a standard guitar. \n\nWe can play the Eb note on the B string by playing the note on the sixth fret, which is the same as playing the first fret on a standard guitar. \n\nNow we have the final answer:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 8\nC string: fret X\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret 5\nB string: fret 6\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
