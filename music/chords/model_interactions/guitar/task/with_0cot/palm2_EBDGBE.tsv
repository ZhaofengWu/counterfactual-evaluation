On a guitar tuned to E-B-D-G-B-E, the notes Ab, C, Eb, and G# correspond to the following frets:\n\n* Ab: fret 5 on the B string\n* C: fret 3 on the G string\n* Eb: fret 1 on the D string\n* G#: fret 2 on the B string\n\nTherefore, the Ab augmented seventh chord (aug7) can be played on a guitar tuned to E-B-D-G-B-E as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: X\nB string: fret 5\nD string: fret 1\nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret 2\nE string: X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
