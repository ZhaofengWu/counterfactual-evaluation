Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Step 1: Identify the notes in a G sixth chord. A G sixth chord consists of the notes G, B, D, and E.\n\nStep 2: Determine the location of these notes on the guitar. On a standard-tuned guitar, the notes would be found on the third fret of the low E string (G), the second fret of the A string (B), the open D string (D), the open G string (G), the second fret of the B string (B), and the third fret of the high E string (E).\n\nStep 3: Adjust for the non-standard tuning. Since the A string is tuned to B, we need to adjust the location of the B note in the chord. Instead of playing the second fret of the A string, we will play the open B string.\n\nStep 4: Determine the frets to play on each string. Based on the adjusted notes, we can play the G sixth chord on this guitar as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 3\nB string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 3	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Step 1: Determine the notes in a C dom7 chord\nA C dom7 chord consists of the notes C, E, G, and Bb.\n\nStep 2: Find the corresponding notes on the guitar\nUsing the tuning E-B-D-G-B-E, we can find the notes on the guitar as follows:\n\nE string: E\nB string: B\nD string: D\nG string: G\nB string: B\nE string: E\n\nStep 3: Determine the frets needed to play the C dom7 chord\nTo play a C dom7 chord, we need to find the frets on each string that correspond to the notes C, E, G, and Bb.\n\nE string: We need to find the note C on the E string. Since the E string is already tuned to E, we need to find the note C two frets down from the open string. Therefore, we need to play fret 3 on the E string.\n\nB string: We need to find the note E on the B string. Since the B string is tuned to B, we need to find the note E four frets up from the open string. Therefore, we need to play fret 4 on the B string.\n\nD string: We need to find the note G on the D string. Since the D string is already tuned to G, we need to find the note G on the open string.\n\nG string: We need to find the note Bb on the G string. Since the G string is already tuned to G, we need to find the note Bb one fret down from the open string. Therefore, we need to play fret 1 on the G string.\n\nB string: We need to find the note E on the B string. Since the B string is tuned to B, we need to find the note E four frets up from the open string. Therefore, we need to play fret 4 on the B string.\n\nE string: We need to find the note C on the E string. Since the E string is already tuned to E, we need to find the note C two frets down from the open string. Therefore, we need to play fret 3 on the E string.\n\nStep 4: Put it all together\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 3\nB string: fret 4\nD string: open\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret 3	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a B sixth chord: B, D#, F#, and G#. \n\nNext, let's figure out where these notes are on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\n- The B note is on the second string (which is tuned to B instead of A) at fret 2. \n- The D# note is on the third string at fret 1. \n- The F# note is on the fourth string at fret 2. \n- The G# note is on the fifth string at fret 1. \n\nNow, we need to find a way to play all of these notes together in a chord. \n\nOne possible way to play a B sixth chord on this guitar is: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret X \nB string: fret 2 \nD string: fret 1 \nG string: fret 1 \nB string: fret 2 \nE string: fret X \n\nThis involves playing the second string (which is tuned to B) at fret 2, the third string at fret 1, and the fourth and fifth strings at fret 1. The first and sixth strings are not played in this chord. \n\nOf course, there are many other ways to play a B sixth chord on guitar, and you may find a different fingering that works better for you on this non-standard tuning.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an A suspended second chord. It consists of the notes A, B, and E. \n\nOn our guitar with the non-standard tuning, the B string is tuned to what is normally the A string. So we can use that string to play the B note in the chord. \n\nHere's one possible way to play the A suspended second chord on this guitar:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nB string: fret 2\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nThis fingering uses the open E and B strings, and then frets the second fret on the D, G, and B strings. This gives us the notes E, B, D, and A (which is the open A string). \n\nBy playing these notes together, we get the A suspended second chord.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to find the E note on the guitar. Since the tuning is different, we cannot rely on the standard E string. Instead, we need to find the E note on the B string, which is tuned to B.\n\nTo find the E note on the B string, we need to move up four frets from the B note. This is because the distance between B and E is a perfect fourth, which spans four frets on a guitar.\n\nSo, the E note on the guitar is located on the 5th fret of the B string.\n\nNow that we know where the E note is, we can play the E fifth interval by finding another E note that is five frets higher. This means we need to play the E note on the 10th fret of the D string.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nB string: fret 5\nD string: fret 10\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 5\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to find the notes that make up the Db minor triad. The triad consists of the notes Db, Fb, and Ab.\n\nNext, we need to find where these notes are located on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\nThe E string is still tuned to E, so we can't use it to play any of the notes in the Db minor triad. \n\nThe B string is now tuned to B instead of A, so we can use it to play the note Db. We need to find the fret that corresponds to Db on the B string. \n\nTo do this, we can use a reference chart or a guitar tuner to find the note B on the B string (which is now the equivalent of the A string). Once we find B, we can count up two frets to reach Db. So, the first note of the Db minor triad can be played on the B string, fret 2.\n\nThe D string is still tuned to D, so we can't use it to play any of the notes in the Db minor triad. \n\nThe G string is still tuned to G, so we can't use it to play any of the notes in the Db minor triad. \n\nThe second B string is now tuned to B instead of E, so we can use it to play the note Fb. We need to find the fret that corresponds to Fb on the B string. \n\nTo do this, we can use a reference chart or a guitar tuner to find the note B on the B string (which is now the equivalent of the E string). Once we find B, we can count up four frets to reach Fb. So, the second note of the Db minor triad can be played on the second B string, fret 4.\n\nThe second E string is still tuned to E, so we can't use it to play any of the notes in the Db minor triad. \n\nFinally, we need to find the note Ab. We can use the first B string again, but this time we need to find the fret that corresponds to Ab. \n\nTo do this, we can use a reference chart or a guitar tuner to find the note B on the B string (which is now the equivalent of the A string). Once we find B, we can count up six frets to reach Ab. So, the third note of the Db minor triad can be played on the first B string, fret 6.\n\nPutting it all together, the Db minor triad can be played on this guitar as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nB string: fret 2\nD string: fret X\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in an A augmented seventh chord: A, C#, E, and G#. \n\nOn our guitar with the non-standard tuning, we need to figure out where these notes are located on each string. \n\n- E string: The note E is already in the tuning, so we don't need to do anything here. \n- B string: The note we need is C#, which is two frets higher than the B string's tuning. So we need to play fret 2 on the B string. \n- D string: The note we need is G#, which is three frets higher than the D string's tuning. So we need to play fret 3 on the D string. \n- G string: The note we need is E, which is already in the tuning. \n- B string: We need another B, which is already in the tuning. \n- E string: The note we need is A, which is five frets higher than the E string's tuning. So we need to play fret 5 on the E string. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 5 \nB string: fret 2 \nD string: fret 3 \nG string: fret 0 \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since the A string is tuned to B, we need to find the A note on the B string. \n\nTo do this, we can use the fifth fret rule. If we play the note on the fifth fret of the B string, it should be an A note. \n\nSo, the A note on this guitar is played on the fifth fret of the B string. \n\nNow, we need to find the A fifth interval. A fifth interval is found by playing the note on the A string and the note on the B string that is seven half-steps higher. \n\nSince the A string is tuned to E, we need to find the note that is seven half-steps higher than A on the E string. \n\nTo do this, we can use the fifth fret rule again. If we play the note on the fifth fret of the E string, it should be a B note. \n\nSo, the note that is seven half-steps higher than A on the E string is played on the fifth fret of the E string, which is a B note. \n\nNow, we can play the A fifth interval by playing the A note on the fifth fret of the B string and the B note on the fifth fret of the E string. \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 5 \nB string: fret 5 \nD string: fret X \nG string: fret X \nB string: fret 5 \nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since the A string is tuned to B, we can use the B string as a reference. \n\nThe B string is tuned to the note F#, which is two frets higher than the note E on the E string. Therefore, we can find the note Ab on the guitar by moving two frets higher than the note G on the G string. \n\nNow that we know where to find the note Ab, we can determine how to play the Ab fifth interval. \n\nTo play the Ab fifth interval, we need to find the note Eb on the guitar. The Eb note is located on the D string, which is tuned to the note D. We can find the note Eb by moving two frets higher than the note D on the D string. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
