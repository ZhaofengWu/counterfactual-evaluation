You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the E augmented seventh chord (aug7) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An E augmented seventh chord contains the notes E, G#, B, and D#.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\nE string: fret 0  (E note)\nA string: fret 4  (G# note)\nD string: fret 2  (B note) \nG string: fret 3 (D# note)\nB and E strings: fret X (not played)\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to C instead. So we need to find the G# note on a different string.\n4) The G# note can be found on the D string, 2 frets higher than the B note.\n\nTherefore, the E augmented seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0  \nC string: fret X\nD string: fret 4  \nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The B suspended second chord (Bsus2) contains the notes B, C# and E.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by holding down the 2nd fret on the A string, the 2nd fret on the D string, and the open B and E strings.\n3) However, on your guitar, the A string is tuned down to C. So we need to find the C# note on a different string. \n4) The C# note is two frets higher than the C note. Since your C string is tuned to C, we need to hold down the 2nd fret on the C string to get a C# note.\n5) The open B and E strings will provide the B and E notes as normal.\n\nPutting this together, the Bsus2 chord on your guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 2\nD string: fret X  \nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we can't play the A note on the 2nd fret of the G string. \n4) However, the E note is still available on the 2nd fret of the B string. And the D note is still available on the 3rd fret of the E string.\n5) To complete the Dsus2 chord, we need an A note. The A note is two frets higher than the G note, so we can play the 4th fret of the C string to get an A note.\n\nPutting this together, the Dsus2 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 3  \nC string: fret 4\nD string: fret X  \nG string: fret X\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) An F minor triad contains the notes F, Ab, and C.\n2) On a standard guitar, you would play:\nE string: fret 1  (F note)\nA string: fret 3  (C note) \nD string: fret 1  (Ab note)\n\n3) However, on this special guitar, the A string is tuned to C. So we already have the C note on the open C string.\n4) For the F note, we need to play the E string, 1 fret higher than the open E. So E string, fret 1.\n5) For the Ab note, we need to play the D string, 1 fret lower than the open D.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An Eb fifth interval consists of the notes Eb and Bb.\n2) On a standard guitar, Eb is the first fret of the first (E) string, and Bb is the first fret of the third (G) string.\n3) However, on this special guitar, the A string is tuned to C instead. So the third string is C, not G.\n4) A Bb note is 3 frets higher than the C string. So to play a Bb, I would press down on the third fret of the C string.\n\nPutting this together, to play an Eb fifth interval on this special guitar, I would:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 1  \nC string: fret 3\nD string: fret X  \nG string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) A C fifth interval consists of the notes C and G.\n2) On a standard guitar, you could play this interval by fretting the 3rd fret of the A string (C note) and the open G string (G note).\n3) However, on this special guitar, the A string is tuned down to C. So we already have the C note on the open C string. \n4) We just need to find the G note. The G string is tuned normally, so we can play the open G string to get the G note.\n\nPutting this together, here is the answer:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: X \nC string: 0  \nD string: X\nG string: 0\nB string: X\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An Ab fifth interval consists of an Ab note and an Eb note.\n2) On a standard guitar, an Ab note can be played on the 1st fret of the E string or the 3rd fret of the A string. Since the A string is tuned to C in this case, neither of those options will work.\n3) An Eb note can be played on the 1st fret of the D string or the 3rd fret of the G string on a standard guitar. On this guitar, the D and G strings are tuned the same, so the Eb note can be played on the 1st fret of the D string.\n4) Therefore, to play an Ab fifth interval on this guitar, I would play:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: X \nC string: X\nD string: 1\nG string: X  \nB string: X\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an E minor seventh chord are: E, G, B, D.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played as:\nE string: fret 0  (open E note)\nA string: fret 2  (B note)\nD string: fret 2  (G note) \nG string: fret 1  (D note)\nB string: fret 0  (open B note)\nE string: fret 0  (open E note)\n\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to C instead. So we need to find the frets that correspond to the notes B, G, and D on the C, D and G strings respectively.\n4) The C string is tuned a whole step higher than the A string, so fret 2 on the C string would be a C# note, not the B note we want. Fret 4 on the C string corresponds to the B note.\n5) The D and G strings are unchanged, so frets 2 and 1 still correspond to the G and D notes respectively.\n\nPutting this together, the E minor seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0  \nC string: fret 4\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we can play the C note by fretting the C string at the 3rd fret.\n\n4) The D note can be played by fretting the D string at the 2nd fret, just like on a standard guitar. \n\n5) The G note can be played by playing the G string open.\n\n6) The other strings (E, B, E) are not played.\n\nPutting this together, the C sus2 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret X \nC string: fret 3\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) An Ab suspended second chord (Ab sus2) contains the notes Ab, Bb and Eb.\n\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\n\nE string: fret 0  (E)\nA string: fret 1  (Bb)\nD string: fret 3  (Eb)\nG string: fret 0  (G) \nB string: fret 0  (B)\nE string: fret 0  (E)\n\n3) However, on your special guitar, the A string is tuned to C instead. So we need to find the Bb note on a different string.\n\n4) The Bb note can be found on the D string, 2 frets higher than the Eb note.\n\nTherefore, the Ab sus2 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0  \nC string: fret X\nD string: fret 5  \nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in a D minor seventh chord are D, F, A, and C.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the D, G, and B strings. This gives us the notes D, A, and C. The open E and A strings provide the F and A notes.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned down to C. So we can't use the open A string. \n4) Fretting the 2nd fret of the D, G, and B strings will still give us D, A, and C notes.\n5) For the F note, we need to fret the 1st fret of the E string.\n\nPutting this together, the D minor seventh chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER:  \nE string: fret 1  \nC string: fret X\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to adjust for that.\n4) The note Ab is a whole step below Bb. On the standard guitar, we play the Ab on the 1st fret of the A string.  Since your C string is tuned a whole step higher, we need to play two frets lower to get Ab. So, on your C string, we play the Ab on the 3rd fret.\n5) The other notes, Db, F, and Bb, are played on the same frets as the standard guitar.\n\nPutting it all together, the Db sixth chord on your guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 3\nC string: fret 3  \nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to find the Bb, D and F notes on the strings we have.\n4) The Bb note is 2 frets higher than the A note. Since the C string is tuned to what is normally the A string, we need to play the C string at the 4th fret to get a Bb note.\n5) The D note is on the D string, at the 3rd fret as normal. \n6) The F note is on the E string, at the 1st fret as normal.\n\nPutting this together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 1  \nC string: fret 4\nD string: fret 3\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) A B fifth interval consists of the notes B and F#.\n2) On a standard guitar, you could play this interval by holding down the 2nd fret of the B string and the 4th fret of the G string. \n3) However, the tuning of this guitar is different. The A string is tuned to C instead.\n4) To play a B note, we can hold down the 2nd fret of the B string, just like on a standard guitar.\n5) To play an F#, we need to hold down a fret on the C string that is 3 frets higher than the C note. Since the C string is tuned to C, 3 frets higher is F#.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: X \nC string: 4\nD string: X\nG string: X\nB string: 2\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to find the F# note on a different string. \n4) The F# note is 1 fret higher than the F note. On a standard guitar, the F note is found on the 1st fret of the E string.\n5) Therefore, on your guitar, the F# note will be on the 2nd fret of the E string.\n\nPutting this together, the Esus2 chord on your guitar can be played as:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 2  \nC string: fret X\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the A suspended fourth chord (sus4) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The A suspended fourth chord (Asus4) contains the notes A, D and E.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by holding down the 2nd fret on the D, G and B strings. This gives us the notes A, D and E.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to C instead of A. So we cannot play the A note on the 2nd fret of the A string.\n4) However, the D and E notes are still available on the 2nd frets of the D and B strings respectively, just like on a standard guitar.\n5) To get the A note, we need to play the open E string, which is tuned to E.\n\nPutting this together, the Asus4 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret X\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X\n\nSo the notes played are:\nE (open E string) \nD (2nd fret D string)\nE (2nd fret B string)\n\n yielding the A suspended fourth chord.
