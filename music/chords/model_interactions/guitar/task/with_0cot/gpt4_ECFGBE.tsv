The Bb min7 chord consists of the notes Bb, Db, F, and Ab.\n\nNow, let's find these notes on the special guitar tuning E-C-F-G-B-E.\n\n1. E string: To play Bb on the E string, we need to go up 6 half steps from E (E - F - F# - G - G# - A - A#). So, we need to press the 6th fret on the E string.\n\n2. C string: To play Db on the C string, we need to go up 3 half steps from C (C - C# - D - D#). So, we need to press the 3rd fret on the C string.\n\n3. F string: The F string is already playing the F note as an open string, so we don't need to press any fret on the F string.\n\n4. G string: To play Ab on the G string, we need to go up 4 half steps from G (G - G# - A - A# - B). So, we need to press the 4th fret on the G string.\n\n5. B string: To play Db on the B string, we need to go up 8 half steps from B (B - C - C# - D - D# - E - F - F#). So, we need to press the 8th fret on the B string.\n\n6. E string: We don't need to play the high E string for this chord, so we'll mark it as fret X.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 6\nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret 0\nG string: fret 4\nB string: fret 8\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an Eb sus4 chord. The formula for a suspended fourth chord is root, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth. In the case of Eb, the root is Eb, the perfect fourth is Ab, and the perfect fifth is Bb.\n\nNow, let's find these notes on the special guitar tuning E-C-F-G-B-E.\n\n1. E string: The closest note to Eb on the E string is the open E string itself, which is a half step above Eb. We can't play Eb on this string, so we'll have to mute it. \n\n2. C string: The closest note to Eb on the C string is at the 3rd fret, which is an Eb.\n\n3. F string: The closest note to Ab on the F string is at the 1st fret, which is an Ab.\n\n4. G string: The closest note to Bb on the G string is at the 3rd fret, which is a Bb.\n\n5. B string: The closest note to Eb on the B string is at the 4th fret, which is an Eb.\n\n6. E string: The closest note to Ab on the high E string is at the 4th fret, which is an Ab.\n\nSo, to play the Eb sus4 chord on this special guitar, you would play the following:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret 1\nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret 4	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Db suspended second chord (sus2) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a Db sus2 chord. A sus2 chord consists of the root, the major second, and the perfect fifth. In the case of Db sus2, these notes are Db, Eb, and Ab.\n\nNow, let's find these notes on the special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E.\n\n1. Db can be found on the E string at the 11th fret.\n2. Eb can be found on the C string at the 8th fret.\n3. Ab can be found on the F string at the 11th fret.\n4. Db can also be found on the G string at the 6th fret.\n5. Eb can be found on the B string at the 11th fret.\n6. Ab can be found on the high E string at the 4th fret.\n\nWe can now choose a fingering for the Db sus2 chord. One possible fingering is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 11\nC string: fret 8\nF string: fret 11\nG string: fret 6\nB string: fret 11\nE string: fret 4\n\nHowever, this fingering might be difficult to play due to the large stretches between the fingers. A more comfortable fingering could be:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nC string: fret 8\nF string: fret 11\nG string: fret 6\nB string: fret 11\nE string: fret 4\n\nIn this fingering, we don't play the low E string, making it easier to play the chord.

You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Ab fifth interval on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's find the Ab note on the E string. The open E string is E, so we need to go up 4 half steps to reach Ab. Therefore, we need to press the 4th fret on the E string.\n\nNow, let's find the fifth interval from Ab, which is Eb. We can find this note on the C string. The open C string is C, so we need to go up 3 half steps to reach Eb. Therefore, we need to press the 3rd fret on the C string.\n\nWe don't need to play the other strings for this interval, so we can mark them as fret X.\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 4\nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret X\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
