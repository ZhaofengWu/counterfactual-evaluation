Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's find the root note of the Db minor triad, which is Db. \n\nTo play the Db note on the E string, we need to go up 4 frets from the open E string. So, we play the E string on fret 4. \n\nTo play the Db note on the A string, we need to go up 6 frets from the open A string. So, we play the A string on fret 6. \n\nTo play the Db note on the D string, we need to go up 1 fret from the open D string. So, we play the D string on fret 1. \n\nTo play the Fb note (which is the minor third of the Db minor triad) on the G string, we need to go up 4 frets from the open G string. However, there is no Fb note on a standard guitar, so we need to use the enharmonic equivalent, which is E. So, we play the G string on fret 4. \n\nTo play the Ab note (which is the fifth of the Db minor triad) on the B string, we need to go up 6 frets from the open B string. So, we play the B string on fret 6. \n\nTo play the Db note (which is the root note again) on the high E string, we need to go up 4 frets from the open high E string. So, we play the high E string on fret 4. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 4 \nA string: fret 6 \nD string: fret 1 \nG string: fret 4 \nB string: fret 6 \nE string: fret 4	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to find the root note of the Eb minor triad, which is Eb. \n\nTo play an Eb note on the guitar, we can place our finger on the 6th string (E string) at the 6th fret. \n\nNext, we need to add the third and fifth notes of the Eb minor scale to form the triad. \n\nThe third note of the Eb minor scale is Gb, which can be played on the 5th string (A string) at the 4th fret. \n\nThe fifth note of the Eb minor scale is Bb, which can be played on the 4th string (D string) at the 6th fret. \n\nSo, to play the Eb minor triad on the guitar, we would place our fingers on the following frets: \n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 6 \nA string: fret 4 \nD string: fret 6 \nG string: fret X \nB string: fret 8 \nE string: fret 6	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
