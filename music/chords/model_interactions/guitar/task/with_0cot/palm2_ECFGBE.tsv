On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the D, F, and A strings at the second fret. However, on a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E, the D string is tuned to F, so the D suspended second chord is played by fretting the F, G, and B strings at the second fret.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: X\nC string: X\nF string: 2\nG string: 2\nB string: 2\nE string: X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

On a standard guitar, these notes are played on the strings E, A, D, and G, respectively. On our special guitar, however, the strings are tuned to E, C, F, G, B, and E. This means that the notes B, D, F, and A are now played on the strings B, E, G, and C, respectively.\n\nTo play the B diminished seventh chord on our special guitar, we would need to fret the strings B, E, G, and C at the following frets:\n\nB string: fret 7\nE string: fret 1\nG string: fret 3\nC string: fret 5\n\nThis would produce the following notes:\n\nB: 7\nD: 1\nF: 3\nA: 5\n\nThese notes would form the B diminished seventh chord.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Bb dominant seventh chord (dom7) is made up of the notes Bb, D, F, and A. On a standard guitar, these notes are played on the strings E, A, D, and G, respectively. On our special guitar, however, the strings are tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E, so the notes of the Bb dom7 chord are played on the strings E, C, F, G, and B, respectively.\n\nTo play the Bb dom7 chord on our special guitar, we would play the following notes:\n\nE string: fret 7\nC string: fret 5\nF string: fret 3\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 0\n\nThis will produce the following sound:\n\n[Bb] [D] [F] [A]\n\nWhich is the Bb dominant seventh chord.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Db suspended fourth chord (sus4) is a four-note chord consisting of the notes D, F, G, and C. On a standard guitar, the notes D, F, and G are played on the strings D, A, and E, respectively. However, on a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E, the notes D, F, and G are played on the strings E, C, and F, respectively. The note C is the fourth note of the Db major scale, so it is the note that is suspended in the Db sus4 chord.\n\nTo play the Db sus4 chord on a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E, you would play the following notes:\n\nE string: 0\nC string: 2\nF string: 3\nG string: 4\nB string: X\nE string: 0	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

On a standard guitar, the Ab diminished seventh chord is played by fretting the notes Ab, C, Eb, and Gb on the fifth, sixth, seventh, and first strings, respectively. On a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E, the Ab diminished seventh chord is played by fretting the notes Ab, C, Eb, and Gb on the sixth, seventh, eighth, and second strings, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: X\nC string: fret 7\nF string: fret 8\nG string: fret 9\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret 0	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
