On a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-D-G-B-E, the notes Gb, Bb, and Db are played on the 5th, 3rd, and 2nd strings, respectively, and the note F is played on the 1st string. Therefore, the Gb dominant seventh chord (dom7) on a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-D-G-B-E is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 0\nC string: fret 3\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

On a standard guitar, these notes are found on the following strings and frets:\n\n* E string: 1\n* A string: 5\n* D string: 7\n\nOn our special guitar, the strings are tuned differently, so the notes are found on different frets. The Bb minor triad on our special guitar is played as follows:\n\n* E string: 0\n* C string: 3\n* D string: 5\n* G string: 7\n* B string: X\n* E string: 0\n\nThis is because the Bb note is found on the open E string, the D note is found on the 3rd fret of the C string, and the F note is found on the 5th fret of the D string.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Ab diminished seventh chord (dim7) is made up of the notes Ab, C, Eb, and Gb. On a standard guitar, the Ab diminished seventh chord is played by fretting the notes Ab, C, Eb, and Gb on the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th frets of the E, A, D, and G strings, respectively.\n\nOn a guitar with strings tuned to E-C-D-G-B-E, the Ab diminished seventh chord is played by fretting the notes Ab, C, Eb, and Gb on the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th frets of the E, C, D, and G strings, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 4\nC string: fret 6\nD string: fret 8\nG string: fret 10\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
