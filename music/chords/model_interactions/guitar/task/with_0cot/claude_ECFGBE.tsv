You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to E-C-F-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard A string is instead tuned to C, and the standard D string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Eb suspended second chord (sus2) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An Eb suspended second chord contains the notes Eb, G, and Bb.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret on the A string, the 2nd fret on the D string, and the 1st fret on the G string. \n3) However, on this special guitar, the A string is tuned to C and the D string is tuned to F. So we need to account for these different tunings.\n4) The C string is tuned a whole step higher than the A string, so we need to fret one fret higher, the 3rd fret, to get the G note.\n5) The F string is tuned a perfect fourth higher than the D string, so we need to fret four frets higher, the 5th fret, to get the Bb note.\n6) The G string is unchanged, so we fret the 1st fret to get the Eb note.\n\nPutting this together, the Eb suspended second chord on this special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 3\nF string: fret 5\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret X  \nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The A suspended second chord (A sus2) contains the notes A, B and E.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by holding down the 2nd fret on the D string, the 2nd fret on the G string, and leaving the E, A and B strings open. This gives the notes E, A, B and E.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to C instead of A. So we cannot play an open A string. \n4) The D string is tuned to F instead of D. So holding down the 2nd fret on the F string would give a G note, not a B note.\n5) Therefore, to play an A sus2 chord on your special guitar, we need to find another way to get the notes A, B and E.\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 2  \nF string: fret X\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\n\nThis gives us the notes E, A, B and E, which make up an A suspended second chord.

So we can't play the D note on the 2nd fret of the D string. \n4) Instead, we need to find the D note on a different string. The D note is two frets higher than the C note.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in a D minor seventh chord are D, F, A, and C.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the D, G, and B strings. This gives us the notes D, A, and C. The open E and A strings provide the F and D notes.\n3) On this special guitar, the A string is tuned down to C. So we can get the C note by playing the open C string. \n4) The F note is on the 3rd fret of the F string.\n5) The D note is on the 2nd fret of the E string.\n\nPutting this together, the D minor seventh chord on this special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 2  \nC string: fret 0\nF string: fret 3\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The G sus4 chord contains the notes G, C, and D.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by fretting the 3rd fret of the E string (G note), the 2nd fret of the A string (C note), and the 3rd fret of the D string (D note). The other strings are not fretted.\n3) On your special guitar, the A string is tuned to C. So we already have the C note on the 2nd fret of the C string.\n4) The E string is still tuned to E, so we need to fret the 3rd fret to get the G note. \n5) The D string is tuned to F, so we need to fret the 5th fret to get the D note (each fret increase raises the pitch by a half step, so going from F to D requires fretting 2 frets higher).\n\nPutting this together, the G sus4 chord on your special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 3  \nC string: fret 2\nF string: fret 5\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we can play the C note on the open C string.\n4) The Eb note needs to be played on the F string, 2 frets higher than the Eb on a standard guitar. So Eb would be on fret 3 of the F string.\n5) The G note needs to be played on the G string, same as a standard guitar. So G is on fret 3 of the G string.\n6) The Bb note needs to be played on the B string, 1 fret lower than on a standard guitar.

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the E diminished seventh chord (dim7) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nF string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An E diminished seventh chord contains the notes E, G, Bb, and Db.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\nE string: fret 0 \nA string: fret 2 \nD string: fret 1\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret 0\n\n3) However, the tuning of this guitar is different. The A string is tuned to C, and the D string is tuned to F. \n4) To play the same E dim7 chord, we need to find those same notes (E, G, Bb, Db) using the different tuning.\n5) On this guitar:\n- E is still the open E string (fret 0)\n- G can be played on the C string, 2 frets higher (fret 2) \n- Bb can be played on the F string, 1 fret higher (fret 1)\n- Db can be played on the G string, 2 frets higher (fret 2)\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0  \nC string: fret 2\nF string: fret 1\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret X \nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) A Bb fifth interval consists of the notes Bb and F.\n2) On a standard guitar, you could play this interval by fretting the 1st fret of the B string (Bb) and the 1st fret of the D string (F).\n3) However, on this special guitar, the D string is tuned to F instead of A. So we already have an F note on the open F string.\n4) Therefore, to play a Bb fifth interval on this guitar, we need to find the Bb note. The Bb note is a whole step below the B note. On a standard guitar, the B note is on the 2nd fret of the B string. \n5) On this special guitar, the B string is tuned the same. So the Bb note will be on the 1st fret of the B string.\n\nPutting this together, the Bb fifth interval can be played as:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: X \nC string: X\nF string: 0 \nG string: X\nB string: 1\nE string: X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The F suspended second chord (Fsus2) contains the notes F, G, and C.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord is played by holding down the 1st fret of the B string (C note), the 2nd fret of the G string (G note), and the 1st fret of the E string (F note), with the other strings open.\n3) However, the tuning of this special guitar is different. The A string is tuned to C, the D string is tuned to F, and the other strings are standard.\n4) Therefore, to play an Fsus2 chord on this guitar, we need to hold down:\n\n- The C string (2nd fret, G note)\n- The F string (1st fret, F note) \n- The B string (1st fret, C note)\n\nWith the E, G, and E strings open.\n\nPutting this together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 2\nF string: fret 1\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) An Ab suspended fourth chord contains the notes Ab, C, and Eb.\n2) On a standard guitar, this chord would be played as:\nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret 3 \nD string: fret 3\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 0\n\n3) However, the tuning of this special guitar is different. The A string is tuned to C, and the D string is tuned to F. \n4) Therefore, to play an Ab suspended fourth chord on this guitar, we need to find the frets that correspond to the notes Ab, C, and Eb.\n5) On the E string (tuned to E), the first fret is F, so we need to press the first fret to get an Ab.\n6) On the C string (tuned to C), we need to play the open string to get a C.\n7) On the F string (tuned to F), the first fret is Gb, the second fret is Ab, and the third fret is Bb. So we need to press the second fret to get an Eb.\n\nPutting this together, the Ab suspended fourth chord on this guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 1\nC string: fret 0 \nF string: fret 2\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to find those notes on different strings.\n\n4) The note D# is a whole step above C. Since each fret is a half step, we need to go up two frets from the C string to get D#.\n5) The note F# is a whole step above F. Again, going up two frets from the F string will give us F#.\n\nPutting this together, the B major triad on this special guitar would be:\n\nANSWER: \nE string: fret 2  \nC string: fret X\nF string: fret 2\nG string: fret X \nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
