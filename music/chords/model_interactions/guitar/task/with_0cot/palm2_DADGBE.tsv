Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Db dominant seventh chord (dom7) is made up of the notes Db, F, Ab, and C. On a standard guitar, the notes Db, F, and Ab are played on the 5th, 7th, and 10th frets of the D, A, and G strings, respectively. The note C is played on the 8th fret of the B string.\n\nOn a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the notes Db, F, and Ab are played on the 0th, 2nd, and 5th frets of the D, A, and G strings, respectively. The note C is played on the 4th fret of the B string.\n\nTherefore, the Db dominant seventh chord (dom7) on a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 2\nD string: fret 5\nG string: fret 4\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Db augmented seventh chord (aug7) consists of the notes Db, F, Ab, and C. On a standard guitar, the notes Db, F, and Ab are played on the 5th, 7th, and 10th frets of the D, A, and D strings, respectively. The note C is played on the 8th fret of the G string.\n\nOn a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the notes Db, F, and Ab are played on the 0th, 2nd, and 5th frets of the D, A, and D strings, respectively. The note C is played on the 4th fret of the G string.\n\nTherefore, the Db augmented seventh chord (aug7) on a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 2\nD string: fret 5\nG string: fret 4\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

On a standard guitar, the Eb diminished seventh chord is played by fretting the notes Eb, G, Bb, and Db on the fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh frets of the D, A, D, and G strings, respectively.\n\nOn a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the Eb diminished seventh chord is played by fretting the notes Eb, G, Bb, and Db on the fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth frets of the D, A, D, and G strings, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 4\nA string: fret 6\nD string: fret 8\nG string: fret 10\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

On a standard guitar, the G sus2 chord is played by fretting the G, B, and D strings at the second fret. However, on a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the G sus2 chord is played by fretting the G, B, and D strings at the first fret.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 1\nA string: fret 1\nD string: fret 1\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

On a guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the notes Gb, Bb, and Db are played on the 5th, 3rd, and 2nd strings, respectively, and the note F is played on the 1st string.

You are an expert guitar player. I have a special guitar with strings tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E instead of the standard E-A-D-G-B-E. Note that what is the standard low E string is instead tuned to D. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Gb major triad on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Gb major triad consists of the notes Gb, Bb, and Db. On a standard guitar, these notes are played on the following strings and frets:\n\n* D string: fret 3\n* A string: fret 2\n* D string: fret 5\n* G string: fret 3\n* B string: fret 1\n* E string: fret X\n\nOn a guitar tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the notes Gb, Bb, and Db are played on the following strings and frets:\n\n* D string: fret 0\n* A string: fret 1\n* D string: fret 3\n* G string: fret 0\n* B string: fret 2\n* E string: fret X\n\nTherefore, the Gb major triad on a guitar tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 1\nD string: fret 3\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The F fifth interval is four half steps above the D note. On a standard guitar, the D note is played on the fifth fret of the low E string. So, on a guitar tuned to D-A-D-G-B-E, the F fifth interval is played on the first fret of the D string.\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 1\nA string: fret 0\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 0\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
