All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Db suspended second chord (sus2) on this guitar.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nF string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\nD string: fret FRET\nG string: fret FRET\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Db suspended second chord (sus2) is made up of the notes D, F, and A. On a standard guitar, the notes D, F, and A are played on the 5th, 2nd, and 1st strings, respectively. On a guitar with strings tuned to F-A-D-G-B-E, the notes D, F, and A are played on the 4th, 1st, and 0th strings, respectively. Therefore, the Db suspended second chord (sus2) on a guitar with strings tuned to F-A-D-G-B-E is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nF string: fret 0\nA string: fret 1\nD string: fret 4\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
