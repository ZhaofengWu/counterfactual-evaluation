A sus2 chord consists of the root, the major second, and the perfect fifth. In the case of Bb sus2, these notes are Bb, C, and F.\n\nNow, let's find these notes on the special guitar with strings tuned to E-B-D-G-B-E.\n\n1. The lowest E string: We can find the Bb note on the 6th fret of the E string.\n2. The B string (tuned to B): We can find the F note on the 8th fret of the B string.\n3. The D string: We can find the C note on the 10th fret of the D string.\n4. The G string: We can find the F note on the 10th fret of the G string.\n5. The B string (tuned to B): We can find the Bb note on the 11th fret of the B string.\n6. The highest E string: We can find the C note on the 8th fret of the E string.\n\nNow, let's choose a fingering that allows us to play these notes together. We can play the Bb note on the 6th fret of the E string, the F note on the 8th fret of the B string, and the C note on the 10th fret of the D string. We will not play the G string, the B string (tuned to B), and the highest E string.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret 6\nB string: fret 8\nD string: fret 10\nG string: fret X\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a Dsus2 chord. A Dsus2 chord consists of the notes D, E, and A.\n\nNow, let's find these notes on the given guitar tuning (E-B-D-G-B-E).\n\n1. E string (lowest): To play the note D, we need to press the E string on the 10th fret.\n2. B string: To play the note A, we need to press the B string on the 7th fret.\n3. D string: This is already the note D, so we can play it open (fret 0).\n4. G string: To play the note A, we need to press the G string on the 2nd fret.\n5. B string (second highest): To play the note E, we need to press the B string on the 5th fret.\n6. E string (highest): This is already the note E, so we can play it open (fret 0).\n\nNow, let's choose a practical fingering for the Dsus2 chord. We can't play all the strings at once, so we need to choose which strings to play and which to mute.\n\nA possible fingering for the Dsus2 chord is:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nB string: fret 7\nD string: fret 0\nG string: fret 2\nB string: fret 5\nE string: fret 0	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an Ab sus2 chord. A sus2 chord consists of the root, the major second, and the perfect fifth. In this case, the root is Ab, the major second is Bb, and the perfect fifth is Eb.\n\nNow, let's find these notes on your specially tuned guitar:\n\n1. E string (lowest): We won't use this string for this chord, so it will be fret X.\n2. B string: The B string is already tuned to B, so we need to go down one half step to Bb. This is done by playing the first fret.\n3. D string: The D string is tuned to D, so we need to go up one whole step to Eb. This is done by playing the second fret.\n4. G string: The G string is tuned to G, so we need to go down one whole step to Ab. This is done by playing the first fret.\n5. B string (second highest): The B string is already tuned to B, so we need to go down one half step to Bb. This is done by playing the first fret.\n6. E string (highest): We won't use this string for this chord, so it will be fret X.\n\nSo, to play the Ab sus2 chord on your specially tuned guitar, you would play the following:\n\nANSWER:\nE string: fret X\nB string: fret 1\nD string: fret 2\nG string: fret 1\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret X	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
