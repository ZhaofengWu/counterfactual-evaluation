The Bb minor triad consists of the notes Bb, Db, and F.\n\nNext, we need to find where these notes are located on our guitar with the non-standard tuning. \n\nStarting with the D string, we need to find the note Bb. Since the low E string is tuned to D, we can simply play the open D string to get the note Bb.\n\nMoving on to the A string, we need to find the note Db. We can play the 6th fret on the A string to get the note Db.\n\nFor the second D string, we need to find the note F. We can play the 3rd fret on the D string to get the note F.\n\nNext, we move to the G string to find the note Bb again. We can play the 3rd fret on the G string to get the note Bb.\n\nFor the B string, we need to find the note Db again. We can play the 1st fret on the B string to get the note Db.\n\nFinally, for the E string, we need to find the note F again. We can play the 6th fret on the E string to get the note F.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 0\nA string: fret 6\nD string: fret 3\nG string: fret 3\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 6	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to find the note B on the D-A-D-G-B-E tuning. \n\nB is located on the 4th fret of the G string in standard tuning. However, in this tuning, the G string is tuned to D. Therefore, we need to find the note B on the D string, which is two strings lower than the G string. \n\nTo find the note B on the D string, we need to move up five frets from the open D string, which is equivalent to the 7th fret. \n\nNow that we know where the note B is located on the D string, we need to find a string that is tuned to a fifth above the D string. In standard tuning, the A string is tuned to a fifth above the D string. However, in this tuning, the A string is also tuned to D. \n\nTherefore, we need to find a string that is tuned to a fifth above the D string, which is the G string. \n\nTo play the B fifth interval, we need to play the note B on the 7th fret of the D string and the note F# on the 6th fret of the G string. \n\nANSWER: \nD string: fret 7 \nA string: fret X \nD string: fret X \nG string: fret 6 \nB string: fret X \nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an Ab sixth chord: Ab, C, Eb, F. \n\nSince our guitar is tuned differently, we need to find these notes on our strings. \n\n- The D string is tuned to D, which is a whole step lower than E. To play an Ab note, we need to fret the D string at the 4th fret, which is a whole step lower than the 5th fret on a standard guitar.\n- The A string is tuned to A, which is the same as on a standard guitar. To play a C note, we need to fret the A string at the 3rd fret, which is the same as on a standard guitar.\n- The D string is tuned to D, which we already used for the Ab note. To play an Eb note, we need to fret the D string at the 6th fret, which is a whole step higher than the 4th fret we used for the Ab note.\n- The G string is tuned to G, which is the same as on a standard guitar.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to find the note Eb on the D-A-D-G-B-E tuning. \n\nEb is a half step lower than E, so we need to move the note on the low E string down one fret. Since the low E string is tuned to D, we need to play the note D# on the low E string. \n\nTo play D# on the low E string, we need to fret the first fret. \n\nNow, we need to find the note Bb on the D-A-D-G-B-E tuning. \n\nBb is a whole step lower than C, so we need to move the note on the B string up two frets. \n\nTo play Bb on the B string, we need to fret the third fret. \n\nSo, to play the Eb fifth interval on this guitar, we would play: \n\nANSWER: \nD string: fret 5 \nA string: fret X \nD string: fret 7 \nG string: fret 6 \nB string: fret 3 \nE string: fret 5	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to find the note Ab on the guitar. Ab is located on the 4th fret of the G string in standard tuning. However, since our guitar is tuned differently, we need to find Ab on a different string.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a guitar chord chart or a guitar tuner app that allows you to input the alternate tuning. Using such a tool, we can find that Ab is located on the 9th fret of the D string in our tuning.\n\nNow, we need to find the note that is a fifth above Ab. A fifth above Ab is Eb. We can find Eb on the 6th fret of the A string in standard tuning. However, since our guitar is tuned differently, we need to find Eb on a different string.\n\nAgain, we can use a guitar chord chart or a guitar tuner app to find that Eb is located on the 11th fret of the G string in our tuning.\n\nSo, to play the Ab fifth interval on this guitar, we would play:\n\nANSWER:\nD string: fret 9\nA string: fret X\nD string: fret X\nG string: fret 11\nB string: fret X\nE string: fret X\n\nWe play the 9th fret on the D string (which is Ab), and the 11th fret on the G string (which is Eb).

First, we need to find the note A on the D-A-D-G-B-E tuning. \n\nThe A note is located on the 5th fret of the low E string in standard tuning. However, in this tuning, the low E string is tuned down to D. Therefore, we need to move down two frets from the 5th fret to find the A note on the D string. \n\nSo, the A note can be played on the 3rd fret of the D string. \n\nNext, we need to find the note that is a fifth above A. \n\nA fifth above A is E. In standard tuning, the E note is located on the 2nd fret of the D string. However, in this tuning, the D string is already tuned to D. Therefore, we need to move up two strings to find the E note. \n\nSo, the E note can be played on the 2nd fret of the G string. \n\nTherefore, to play the A fifth interval on this guitar, we would play: \n\nANSWER: \nD string: fret 3 \nA string: fret X \nD string: fret X \nG string: fret 2 \nB string: fret X \nE string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

It consists of the notes E, F#, and B. \n\nSince our guitar is tuned differently, we need to find these notes on our strings. \n\n- The low D string is equivalent to the standard low E string. We need to find the note E on this string. We can do this by playing the second fret on the D string, which is equivalent to the open E string. \n- The A string is the same as in standard tuning.

To get to Eb, we need to go down three frets. So we'll play the A string on fret 3. \n- The D string is already tuned to the root note (Db), so we don't need to change anything there. \n- The G string is tuned to a G, which is a major third above our desired fifth note (Ab). To get to Ab, we need to go down four frets. So we'll play the G string on fret 4. \n- The B string is already tuned to a B, which is not part of the Db sus2 chord. We'll need to skip this string. \n- The E string is already tuned to an E, which is not part of the Db sus2 chord.
