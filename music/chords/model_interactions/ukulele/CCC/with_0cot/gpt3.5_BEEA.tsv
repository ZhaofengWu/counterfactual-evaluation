You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-E-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-E-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we look at the B string, which is tuned to what is normally the G string. The finger position is fret 0, which means we play the open string. Therefore, the note played on the B string is B.\n\nNext, we look at the first E string, which is tuned to what is normally the C string. The finger position is also fret 0, so we play the open string. Therefore, the note played on the first E string is E.\n\nMoving on to the second E string, which is also tuned to what is normally the C string. The finger position is again fret 0, so we play the open string. Therefore, the note played on the second E string is also E.\n\nFinally, we look at the A string, which is tuned to what is normally the A string. The finger position is fret 0, so we play the open string. Therefore, the note played on the A string is A.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: B-E-E-A	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to identify the notes of each string in this tuning:\n\n- B string (formerly G string): tuned to B\n- E string (formerly C string): tuned to E\n- E string (still E string): tuned to E\n- A string (still A string): tuned to A\n\nNow, let's look at the finger positions given:\n\n- B string: fret 1 -> this means we are playing a C note (since the B string is tuned to B, and going up one fret raises the note by half a note)\n- E string: fret 1 -> this means we are playing a F# note (since the E string is tuned to E, and going up one fret raises the note by half a note)\n- E string: fret 1 -> again, this means we are playing a F# note\n- A string: fret 1 -> this means we are playing a B note (since the A string is still tuned to A, and going up one fret raises the note by half a note)\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: C-F#-F#-B	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
