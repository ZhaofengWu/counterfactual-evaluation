You are an expert ukulele player. I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nG string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings G-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Since all the strings are played open (fret 0), the notes will be the same as the standard tuning of the ukulele.\n\nANSWER: G-C-E-A	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nG string: fret 1\nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret 1\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings G-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's find out the notes for each string when played at fret 1:\n\nG string: fret 1 - The G string is tuned to G, so when you press down on fret 1, you are increasing the pitch by a half step. G to G#.\n\nC string: fret 1 - The C string is tuned to C, so when you press down on fret 1, you are increasing the pitch by a half step. C to C#.\n\nE string: fret 1 - The E string is tuned to E, so when you press down on fret 1, you are increasing the pitch by a half step. E to F.\n\nA string: fret 1 - The A string is tuned to A, so when you press down on fret 1, you are increasing the pitch by a half step. A to A#.\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings G-C-E-A:\n\nANSWER: G#-C#-F-A#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nG string: fret 2\nC string: fret 2\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 2\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings G-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's determine the notes for each string when played open (fret 0):\nG string: G\nC string: C\nE string: E\nA string: A\n\nNow, let's find the notes for each string when played at fret 2. Since each fret corresponds to an increase in half a note, fret 2 is a whole note higher than the open string.\n\nG string: fret 2 is a whole note higher than G, which is A.\nC string: fret 2 is a whole note higher than C, which is D.\nE string: fret 2 is a whole note higher than E, which is F#.\nA string: fret 2 is a whole note higher than A, which is B.\n\nSo, the sequence of finger positions corresponds to the following notes:\n\nANSWER: A-D-F#-B	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
