You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to F-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nF string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings F-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's go through this carefully:\n\nF string: fret 0 = F \nC string: fret 0 = C\nE string: fret 0 = E\nA string: fret 0 = A\n\nSo the sequence of notes for those finger positions on the special ukulele tuned F-C-E-A would be:\n\nANSWER: F-C-E-A	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
