You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to F-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nF string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings F-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nF string: F (fret 0)\nC string: C (fret 0)\nE string: E (fret 0)\nA string: A (fret 0)\n\nSince all the strings are played open (fret 0), there are no changes to the notes.\n\nANSWER: F-C-E-A	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's find out the notes for each string when played at fret 1:\n\nF string: fret 1 - F is the open string, so fret 1 is a half step higher, which is F#.\n\nC string: fret 1 - C is the open string, so fret 1 is a half step higher, which is C#.\n\nE string: fret 1 - E is the open string, so fret 1 is a half step higher, which is F.\n\nA string: fret 1 - A is the open string, so fret 1 is a half step higher, which is A#.\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings F-C-E-A:\n\nANSWER: F#-C#-F-A#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
