You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to A-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to A. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nA string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings A-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's go through this carefully:\n\nA string (fret 0): A \nC string (fret 0): C\nE string (fret 0): E\nA string (fret 0): A\n\nSo the sequence of notes for those finger positions on the ukulele tuned A-C-E-A would be:\n\nANSWER: A-C-E-A	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
