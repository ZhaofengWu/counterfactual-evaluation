You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's go through this carefully:\n\nB string: fret 0 = B \nC string: fret 0 = C\nE string: fret 0 = E\nA string: fret 0 = A\n\nSo the sequence of notes for those finger positions on the special ukulele tuned B-C-E-A would be:\n\nANSWER: B-C-E-A	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's go through this carefully:\n\nB string: fret 1 \n- This would be C# (one fret higher than the open B string)\n\nC string: fret 1\n- This is D (one fret higher than the open C string)\n\nE string: fret 1 \n- This is F# (one fret higher than the open E string)\n\nA string: fret 1\n- This is B (one fret higher than the open A string)\n\nPutting this together, the sequence of notes for those finger positions would be:\n\nANSWER: C#-D-F#-B	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
