You are an expert ukulele player. I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nG string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings G-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the note of each open string:\n\nG string: open string = G\nC string: open string = C\nE string: open string = E\nA string: open string = A\n\nNext, we need to determine the note produced by each fretted string:\n\nG string: fret 0 (open string) = G\nC string: fret 0 (open string) = C\nE string: fret 0 (open string) = E\nA string: fret 0 (open string) = A\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: G-C-E-A	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
