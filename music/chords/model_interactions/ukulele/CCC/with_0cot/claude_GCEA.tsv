You are an expert ukulele player. I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nG string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings G-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's go through this carefully:\n\nG string: fret 0 = G \nC string: fret 0 = C\nE string: fret 0 = E\nA string: fret 0 = A\n\nSo the notes corresponding to those finger positions are:\n\nANSWER: G-C-E-A	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:\n\nG string: fret 1 \n- This is 1 fret above the open G string, so it corresponds to G#\n\nC string: fret 1\n- This is 1 fret above the open C string, so it corresponds to C#\n\nE string: fret 1 \n- This is 1 fret above the open E string, so it corresponds to F \n\nA string: fret 1\n- This is 1 fret above the open A string, so it corresponds to A#\n\nPutting this together, the sequence of notes is:\n\nANSWER: G#-C#-F-A#	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
