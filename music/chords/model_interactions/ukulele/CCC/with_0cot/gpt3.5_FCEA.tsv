You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to F-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to F. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nF string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings F-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes of the open strings on this special ukulele. The F string is now the lowest string and is tuned to F. The C, E, and A strings are the same as in standard tuning and are tuned to C, E, and A respectively.\n\nNext, we need to determine the notes produced by the finger positions given. Since all the strings are played open, the notes produced are the same as the open string notes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: F-C-E-A	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
