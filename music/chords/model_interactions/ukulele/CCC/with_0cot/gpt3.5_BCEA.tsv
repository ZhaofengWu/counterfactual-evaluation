You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes of each string in this tuning:\n\n- B string (formerly G string): open string is now tuned to B\n- C string: remains the same, open string is tuned to C\n- E string: remains the same, open string is tuned to E\n- A string: remains the same, open string is tuned to A\n\nNow, let's look at the finger positions given:\n\n- B string: fret 0 (open string) = B\n- C string: fret 0 (open string) = C\n- E string: fret 0 (open string) = E\n- A string: fret 0 (open string) = A\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER: B-C-E-A	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 1\nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret 1\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes of each string in this tuning:\n\nB string: This is the equivalent of the standard G string, but tuned up a whole step. So, the note played when the string is played open is A.\n\nC string: This is the same as the standard C string, so the note played when the string is played open is C.\n\nE string: This is the same as the standard E string, so the note played when the string is played open is E.\n\nA string: This is the same as the standard A string, so the note played when the string is played open is A.\n\nNow, we can apply the finger positions given:\n\nB string: fret 1 - This means we are playing a note that is one half step higher than the open string note of A. So, the note played is A#.\n\nC string: fret 1 - This means we are playing a note that is one half step higher than the open string note of C. So, the note played is C#.\n\nE string: fret 1 - This means we are playing a note that is one half step higher than the open string note of E. So, the note played is F.\n\nA string: fret 1 - This means we are playing a note that is one half step higher than the open string note of A. So, the note played is A#.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: A#-C#-F-A#	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
