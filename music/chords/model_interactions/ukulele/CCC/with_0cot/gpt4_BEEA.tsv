You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-E-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-E-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nB string: fret 0 - B\nE string: fret 0 - E\nE string: fret 0 - E\nA string: fret 0 - A\n\nNow, let's put them together in the order of strings B-E-E-A:\n\nANSWER: B-E-E-A	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 1\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret 1\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-E-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's determine the notes for each string at the given frets:\n\nB string: fret 1\nSince the B string is tuned to B, pressing the first fret will raise the note by a half step. B to C is a half step, so the note on the B string at fret 1 is C.\n\nE string: fret 1\nSince the E string is tuned to E, pressing the first fret will raise the note by a half step. E to F is a half step, so the note on the E string at fret 1 is F.\n\nE string: fret 1\nThis is the same as the previous string, so the note is also F.\n\nA string: fret 1\nSince the A string is tuned to A, pressing the first fret will raise the note by a half step. A to A# is a half step, so the note on the A string at fret 1 is A#.\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings B-E-E-A:\n\nANSWER: C-F-F-A#	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's find out the notes for each string at the given frets:\n\nB string: fret 2\nSince the B string is tuned to B, and each fret increases the note by a half step, fret 2 would be:\nB (open) -> C (fret 1) -> C# (fret 2)\n\nE string: fret 2\nSince the E string is tuned to E, and each fret increases the note by a half step, fret 2 would be:\nE (open) -> F (fret 1) -> F# (fret 2)\n\nE string: fret 2 (same as above)\nF#\n\nA string: fret 2\nSince the A string is tuned to A, and each fret increases the note by a half step, fret 2 would be:\nA (open) -> A# (fret 1) -> B (fret 2)\n\nNow, let's put the notes together in the order of strings B-E-E-A:\n\nANSWER: C#-F#-F#-B	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
