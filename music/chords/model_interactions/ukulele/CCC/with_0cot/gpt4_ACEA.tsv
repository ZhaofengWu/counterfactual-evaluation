You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to A-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to A. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nA string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings A-C-E-A.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes for each open string:\n\nA string: A (fret 0)\nC string: C (fret 0)\nE string: E (fret 0)\nA string: A (fret 0)\n\nSince all the finger positions are at fret 0, the notes will be the same as the open strings.\n\nANSWER: A-C-E-A	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
