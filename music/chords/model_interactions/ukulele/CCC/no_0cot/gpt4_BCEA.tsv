You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me what notes the following sequences of finger positions corresponds to: \n\nB string: fret 0\nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0\n\nNote that fret 0 indicates an open string, and each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note. \n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and format with dash-separated notes in the order of strings B-C-E-A.	ANSWER: B-C-E-A	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To find the notes for each string at the given frets, we need to count the half steps up from the open string note.\n\nB string: fret 2\nB (open) -> C (1st fret) -> C# (2nd fret)\n\nC string: fret 2\nC (open) -> C# (1st fret) -> D (2nd fret)\n\nE string: fret 2\nE (open) -> F (1st fret) -> F# (2nd fret)\n\nA string: fret 2\nA (open) -> A# (1st fret) -> B (2nd fret)\n\nANSWER: C#-D-F#-B	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
