You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the A minor seventh chord (min7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an A minor seventh chord are A, C, E and G.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord is played by fretting the C string at the first fret (for the C note), the E string at the second fret (for the E note) and leaving the G and A strings open (for the G and A notes).\n3) On your special ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So we can't leave that string open. \n4) The next lowest note we need is the G note. The G note is two frets higher than the open B note.\n5) Therefore, on your special ukulele, the A minor seventh chord can be played by:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 2 \nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The C sixth chord on a standard ukulele contains the notes C, E, G, and A.\n2) On this ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So we need to find a way to play the G note on a different string.\n3) The E string is tuned to the same E as a standard ukulele. So we can use the E string for the E note in the chord.\n4) The A string is also tuned the same, so we can use it for the A note. \n5) To get the G note, we can fret the C string at the 3rd fret, which produces a G note.\n6) The B string is tuned higher, so we won't use it for this chord.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: X \nC string: 3\nE string: 0 \nA string: 0\n\nSo the C sixth chord on this ukulele would be played with the C string fretted at the 3rd fret, the E and A strings open, and not playing the B string.

So we cannot play that string open for a G note.\n4) The F note, however, can still be played on the 1st fret of the E string, as on a standard ukulele. \n5) The C notes can still be played open on the C and A strings.\n\nPutting this together, the Csus4 chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret X \nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret 0\n\nSo you would not play the B string, play the E string at the 1st fret (for an F note), and play the C and A strings open (for C notes).\n\nLet me know if this makes sense or if you have any other questions!

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an Eb suspended fourth chord are Eb, Ab and Bb.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this would be:\nG string: fret 1  (Eb)\nC string: fret 3 (Bb)\nE string: open (E) \nA string: fret 1 (Ab)\n\n3) However, on your ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So we need to adjust. The Eb note needs to move up to the next higher string.\n\n4) The next higher string from G is C. Fretting the C string on the 1st fret will produce an Eb note.\n\n5) The other notes, Bb and Ab, stay on the same strings (E and A strings respectively), but need to move up in pitch. Bb moves to fret 4 on the E string. Ab moves to fret 2 on the A string.\n\n6) Putting this together, the Eb suspended fourth chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: X \nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 4\nA string: fret 2	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in a D minor seventh chord are D, F, A, and C.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the G string, the 1st fret of the C string, and the 2nd fret of the E string. The A string is left open.\n3) On your ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So we need to find the frets that correspond to the notes D, F, A, and C on the B, C, E and A strings.\n4) The B string is tuned up, so the 2nd fret would be an E, not an F. So we can't play the F note on that string.\n5) The C string is unchanged, so the 1st fret still produces an F note. \n6) The E string is also unchanged, so the 2nd fret still produces an A note.\n7) The open A string still produces an A note.\n\nPutting this together, the D minor seventh chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: X \nC string: 1\nE string: 2\nA string: 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to find the Bb, Db and F on different strings.\n\n4) Bb is 1 fret lower than the open B string. So Bb = 0 fret of B string.\n5) Db is 1 fret higher than the open C string. So Db = 1st fret of C string. \n6) F is 3 frets higher than the open E string.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The A major chord on a standard ukulele is played by fretting the C string at the 2nd fret, the E string at the 2nd fret, and leaving the G and A strings open.\n\n2) On your ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So we can't leave that string open for an A chord. We need to fret that string.\n\n3) Fretting the B string at the 2nd fret would produce a C note, which is not in an A major chord. Fretting at the 1st fret would produce a B note, which is the root note of an A major chord.\n\n4) Therefore, to play an A major chord on your ukulele, we need to fret the B string at the 1st fret, the C string at the 2nd fret, and the E string at the 2nd fret. The A string should be left open.\n\nPutting this all together, here is the answer:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 1\nC string: fret 2  \nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Gb minor seventh chord (min7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in a Gb minor seventh chord are: Gb, Bbb, Db, Fb.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this would be: 0, 1, 3, 3  (open G, fret 1 C, fret 3 E, fret 3 A)\n3) However, the G string is tuned up to B. So we can't play the open G note. \n4) The B string is tuned up from G, so we need to fret it to get a Gb note. Fretting the B string at the 1st fret produces a G note. Fretting it at the 2nd fret would produce G#. So we need to fret the B string at the 1st fret to get a Gb note.\n5) The C, E, and A strings are unchanged, so we fret them at the same frets - 1, 3, 3.\n\nPutting this together, the Gb minor seventh chord on this ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 1  \nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 3	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The Bb suspended second chord (Bbsus2) contains the notes Bb, C and F.\n\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned G-C-E-A, this chord is played by fretting the C string at the 1st fret (for Bb), leaving the C string open (for C), and fretting the E string at the 3rd fret (for F).\n\n3) However, on your ukulele, the G string is replaced with a B string. So we have to figure out how to play the Bb, C and F notes using the B, C, E and A strings.\n\n4) The C note is still played on the open C string.\n\n5) The F note can be played on the 3rd fret of the E string, just like on a standard ukulele. \n\n6) For the Bb note, we can fret the B string at the 1st fret. This produces a B note, which is a half step above Bb.\n\n7) Therefore, the Bbsus2 chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 1  \nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So, the frets/notes on the B string will be a whole step higher than the standard G string.\n5) Therefore, on your ukulele, the notes would correspond to:\nDb = 5th fret of C string (3 frets higher than standard)\nF = 3rd fret of E string (2 frets higher than standard)\nAb = 5th fret of A string (2 frets higher than standard)\n\nPutting this together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: X \nC string: fret 5\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 5	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The B suspended fourth chord (Bsus4) contains the notes B, E and F#.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the G string (to play F#), the open C string (to play C), the open E string (to play E) and not playing the A string.\n3) However, on your ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So to play the F# note, we need to fret the 3rd fret of the B string. \n4) The C and E strings are unchanged, so we play them open.\n5) We do not play the A string.\n\nPutting this together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3  \nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The C suspended second chord (C sus2) contains the notes C, D, and G.\n\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned G-C-E-A, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the C string, the 2nd fret of the E string, and leaving the G and A strings open. This gives the notes C, D, G, and A.\n\n3) On your ukulele tuned B-C-E-A, the B string is tuned up a whole step, so we need to account for that. The C and E strings are the same.\n\n4) To play a C sus2 chord, we need the notes C, D and G.\n- The C note is the open C string \n- The D note can be played on the 2nd fret of the E string, same as a standard ukulele\n- The G note needs to be adjusted. Normally played open, we now need to fret the 3rd fret of the B string to get a G.\n- The A string can be left open.\n\nPutting this together, the C sus2 chord on your B-C-E-A tuned ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3  \nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an Eb suspended second chord are Eb, Ab and Bb.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this would be:\nG string: fret 1  (Eb)\nC string: fret 0  (C) \nE string: fret 3  (Ab)\nA string: fret 1  (Bb)\n\n3) However, on your ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B. So we need to adjust. The Eb note needs to move up to the next higher string.\n\n4) The next higher string from G is C. Fretting the C string on the 1st fret will produce an Eb note.\n\n5) The Ab note remains on the E string, 3rd fret. \n6) The Bb note needs to move up to the next higher string from A, which is the E string.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The E suspended fourth chord (Esus4) contains the notes E, A, and B.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the C string (B note), the open E string (E note), and the open A string (A note). The G string is not played.\n3) On your ukulele, the G string is replaced by a B string. So we already have the B note we need for the Esus4 chord.\n4) We still need the E and A notes. The E string is the same, so we can play that open. \n5) The A note would normally be on the open A string, but on your ukulele the A string is tuned down to G. So we need to fret the A string to raise it to an A note. Fretting the 2nd fret of the A string would raise it to A.\n\nPutting this all together, the Esus4 chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nC string: fret X\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 2	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we need to find the Ab, C, Eb, and G notes on the BCEA tuned strings.\n\n4) The Ab note is 1 fret higher than the G note. Since the B string is tuned a whole step higher than the G string, the Ab note will be on the B string, fret 2.\n5) The C note is still on the C string, fret 0. \n6) The Eb note is 1 fret higher than the E note. So on the E string, fret 1.\n7) The G note is 2 frets higher than the E note. On the standard ukulele, the G note is on the A string, fret 2.

You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Db minor triad on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in a Db minor triad are Db, Fb (which is E), and Ab.\n2) On a standard ukulele, these notes would be played:\nG string (3rd fret)\nC string (1st fret) \nE string (open)\nA string (2nd fret)\n\n3) However, the G string on your ukulele is tuned up to B. So we need to adjust. The B string is a whole step higher than the G string.\n4) To play Db, we need to fret the B string one fret lower, at the 2nd fret.\n5) The C and E strings are unchanged. \n6) To play Ab, we need to fret the A string one fret higher, at the 3rd fret.\n\nPutting this together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 2\nC string: fret 1  \nE string: fret 0 (open)\nA string: fret 3	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the B augmented seventh chord (aug7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) A B augmented seventh chord contains the notes B, D#, F##, and A#.\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned G-C-E-A, this chord would be played as:\nG string: fret 2  (B)\nC string: fret 4 (D#)\nE string: fret 6 (F##)\nA string: fret 0 (A#)\n\n3) However, on your ukulele tuned B-C-E-A, the G string is instead tuned to B. So we already have the B note on the open B string.\n4) For the D# note, we need to fret the C string 2 frets higher than the D note, which is at fret 2. So D# is at fret 4.\n5) For the F## note, we need to fret the E string 4 frets higher than the F note, which is at fret 1. So F## is at fret 5.\n6) The A# note is already provided on the open A string.\n\nPutting this together, the B augmented seventh chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 4\nE string: fret 5\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the A suspended second chord (sus2) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The A suspended second chord (A sus2) contains the notes A, B and E.\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned G-C-E-A, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret on the A string, the open E string, and the open C string. The G string is not played.\n3) On your ukulele, the A string is tuned to B instead of A. So we cannot fret the A string to get an A note.\n4) However, the B string on your ukulele is tuned to B, which is one of the notes we need for an A sus2 chord. \n5) The other notes we need are E (open E string) and C (open C string).\n\nPutting this together, the A suspended second chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret X\n\nSo the A sus2 chord is played by strumming the open B, E and C strings, and not playing the A string.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!
