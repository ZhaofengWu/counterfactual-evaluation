You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-E-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the B augmented seventh chord (aug7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a B augmented seventh chord: B, D#, F#, and A#. \n\nNext, let's figure out where these notes are on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\n- B is already on our B string (tuned to B instead of G in standard tuning). \n- D# is two frets up from the B string on the E string (tuned to E instead of C in standard tuning). So we'll need to play the E string on fret 2. \n- F# is one fret up from the E string on the same E string. So we'll need to play the E string on fret 1. \n- A# is two frets up from the A string (which is still tuned to A in this alternate tuning). So we'll need to play the A string on fret 2. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 2 \nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret 2	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The A minor triad consists of the notes A, C, and E.\n\nNext, we need to find those notes on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\nThe A note is already on the A string, so we don't need to do anything there.\n\nThe C note is usually played on the third fret of the A string in standard tuning, but since our A string is now tuned to E, we need to find the C note on the E string. We can play the C note on the fourth fret of the E string.\n\nThe E note is usually played on the open E string in standard tuning, but since our E string is now tuned to B, we need to find the E note on the B string.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to identify the notes in a B major triad, which are B, D#, and F#. \n\nNext, we need to figure out where these notes are located on our ukulele with the non-standard tuning. \n\nThe B note is located on the first string, which is tuned to B. Therefore, we can play an open string for the B note. \n\nThe D# note is located on the second string, which is tuned to E. We need to find the fret that corresponds to a D# note on the E string. Using a chromatic tuner or a reference chart, we can see that the sixth fret on the E string corresponds to a D# note. \n\nThe F# note is located on the third string, which is also tuned to E. We need to find the fret that corresponds to an F# note on the E string. Using the same method as before, we can see that the ninth fret on the E string corresponds to an F# note. \n\nTherefore, the B major triad on this ukulele would be played as follows: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 6 \nE string: fret 9 \nA string: fret 4	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an E sixth chord: E, G#, B, and C#. \n\nSince our ukulele is tuned differently, we need to figure out which frets to play on each string to produce these notes. \n\nStarting with the B string, we need to play a B note. Since the B string is already tuned to B, we can play it open (fret 0). \n\nMoving on to the E string, we need to play a G# note. To do this, we need to find the note that is two half steps (or two frets) higher than the open E string, which is F# (fret 2). To get to G#, we need to move up one more half step (or one more fret), which brings us to fret 3. So, we need to play the E string on fret 3. \n\nNext, we need to play another E string, but this time we need to play a B note. Since the E string is now tuned to E instead of C, we need to find the note that is two half steps (or two frets) higher than the open E string, which is F# (fret 2). To get to B, we need to move up five more half steps (or five more frets), which brings us to fret 7. So, we need to play the E string on fret 7. \n\nFinally, we need to play an A string, which is already tuned to A. We need to play a C# note, which is four half steps (or four frets) higher than the open A string. So, we need to play the A string on fret 4. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 3 \nE string: fret 7 \nA string: fret 4	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an F major triad: F, A, and C. \n\nOn a standard ukulele tuned to G-C-E-A, we would play the F major triad like this: \n\nG string: fret 2 \nC string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret 3 \n\nHowever, on your ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A, we need to adjust the frets we play on the B and E strings. \n\nHere's how to play the F major triad on your ukulele: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 5 \nE string: fret 4 \nE string: fret 4 \nA string: fret 7 \n\nThis is because the B string is now tuned to what was the G note, which is two half steps higher than the F note. So we need to play the F note on the 5th fret of the B string. \n\nSimilarly, the E string is now tuned to what was the C note, which is also two half steps higher than the A note. So we need to play the A note on the 4th fret of the E string, and the C note on the 4th fret of the other E string. \n\nFinally, we play the F note on the 7th fret of the A string, just like on a standard ukulele. \n\nSo there you have it - the F major triad on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A!

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an E minor seventh chord: E, G, B, and D.\n\nSince our ukulele is tuned differently, we need to find the corresponding notes on our strings. \n\nThe B string is already tuned to B, so we can use that as our root note. \n\nTo find the G note, we need to look for it on the E string, which is now tuned to C. We can find a G note on the 3rd fret of the E string. \n\nFor the B note, we can use the open E string, which is now tuned to B. \n\nFinally, we need to find the D note. We can find a D note on the 2nd fret of the E string. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 3\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in the Ab major triad: Ab, C, and Eb.\n\nTo play Ab on this ukulele, we need to find where the note Ab is on the B string. Since the B string is tuned to what is normally the G string, we can use the same fingering as we would for playing G on a standard ukulele. Therefore, we need to play the 4th fret on the B string to get Ab.\n\nTo play C on this ukulele, we need to find where the note C is on the E string. Since the E string is tuned to what is normally the C string, we can use the same fingering as we would for playing C on a standard ukulele. Therefore, we need to play the 3rd fret on the E string to get C.\n\nTo play Eb on this ukulele, we need to find where the note Eb is on the E string. Since the E string is already tuned to what is normally the G string, we can use the same fingering as we would for playing G on a standard ukulele. Therefore, we need to play the 6th fret on the E string to get Eb.\n\nTherefore, the Ab major triad on this ukulele would be played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret 3\nE string: fret 6\nA string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's identify the notes in a Db augmented seventh chord. \n\nDb augmented seventh chord consists of the following notes: \n\n- Db (root)\n- F (major third)\n- Ab (augmented fifth)\n- B (minor seventh)\n\nNow, let's find these notes on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\n- Db: We don't have a D string, but we can play the Db note on the B string, which is tuned to the same note as the standard G string. So, we'll play the B string open (fret 0) to get the Db note. \n- F: We can play the F note on the E string, which is tuned to the same note as the standard C string. So, we'll play the E string on the third fret to get the F note. \n- Ab: We don't have an Ab note on our ukulele, but we can play the G# note, which is the same note as Ab.

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Db sixth chord on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a Db sixth chord: Db, F, Ab, and Bb. \n\nNext, let's figure out where those notes are on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\n- Db: We don't have a D string, but we do have a B string which is two half steps lower than D. So we can play the Db note on the B string, fret 6. \n- F: We can play the F note on the E string, fret 4. \n- Ab: We can play the Ab note on the E string, fret 6. \n- Bb: We don't have a Bb string, but we do have a A string which is two half steps higher than Bb. So we can play the Bb note on the A string, fret 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 6 \nE string: fret 4 \nE string: fret 6 \nA string: fret 1	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to determine the notes in a Gb minor triad. \n\nA Gb minor triad consists of the notes Gb, Bb, and Db. \n\nNext, we need to find those notes on our ukulele with the non-standard tuning. \n\nThe B string is already tuned to a B note, so we can use that as our starting point. \n\nTo play a Bb note, we need to lower the pitch of the B string by one half step. We can achieve this by pressing down on the first fret of the B string. \n\nTo play a Db note, we need to find the corresponding note on one of the other strings. The closest note to a Db on our ukulele is an E note, which is already tuned to the E string. To lower the pitch of the E string to a Db, we need to press down on the fourth fret. \n\nFinally, we need to find another Bb note to complete the triad. We can achieve this by pressing down on the first fret of the E string, which is already tuned to a B note. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 1 \nE string: fret 1 \nE string: fret 4 \nA string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a G dominant seventh chord. It consists of the notes G, B, D, and F.\n\nNext, let's find those notes on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\n- G is not one of our open strings, so we'll need to fret a note on the B string to get it. \n- B is already an open string for us. \n- D is not an open string, so we'll need to fret a note on the E string to get it. \n- F is not an open string, so we'll need to fret a note on the A string to get it. \n\nNow, let's figure out which frets we need to play to get those notes. \n\n- To get G on the B string, we need to fret the 8th fret. \n- To get D on the E string, we need to fret the 7th fret. \n- To get F on the A string, we need to fret the 5th fret. \n\nFinally, we need to find the note B in the chord. Since it's already an open string for us, we don't need to fret anything for it. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 8 \nE string: fret 7 \nE string: fret X \nA string: fret 5	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The notes are Eb, Ab, and Bb. \n\nNext, let's find those notes on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\n- Eb: We don't have an Eb note on our ukulele, but we can use the B string on the first fret as a substitute. This is because the B note is a tritone away from Eb, which means it has a similar sound and can be used as a substitute in some cases. \n\n- Ab: We don't have an Ab note on our ukulele, but we can use the E string on the third fret as a substitute. This is because the E note is a minor sixth away from Ab, which means it has a similar sound and can be used as a substitute in some cases. \n\n- Bb: We don't have a Bb note on our ukulele, but we can use the E string on the first fret as a substitute. This is because the E note is a major third away from Bb, which means it has a similar sound and can be used as a substitute in some cases. \n\nNow that we have identified the substitute notes, we can put them together to form the Eb sus4 chord on our ukulele with the B-E-E-A tuning. \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 1 \nE string: fret 3 \nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
