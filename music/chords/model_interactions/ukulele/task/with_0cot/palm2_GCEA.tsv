You are an expert ukulele player. I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Eb suspended second chord (sus2) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nG string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Eb suspended second chord (sus2) is made up of the notes Eb, G, and Bb. On a ukulele, the Eb note is played on the G string at the 5th fret, the G note is played on the C string at the 3rd fret, and the Bb note is played on the E string at the 2nd fret. Therefore, the Eb suspended second chord on a ukulele is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nG string: fret 5\nC string: fret 3\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
