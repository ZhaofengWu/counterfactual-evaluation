You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-E-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Gb suspended fourth chord (sus4) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in a Gb suspended fourth chord are: Gb, C, F\n2) On a standard ukulele, this would be:\nG string: fret 1 \nC string: fret 0 (open)\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 0 (open)\n\n3) However, the strings on your ukulele are tuned differently:\nB string: fret ?  (was G string)\nE string: fret ?  (was C string)\nE string: fret ?  (was E string)\nA string: fret ?  (was A string)\n\n4) To figure out the frets, we need to determine which notes the differently tuned strings now correspond to:\n- B string: tuned a whole step higher, so fret 1 is now Bb, fret 2 is now B, fret 3 is now C, and so on.\n- E string: tuned a perfect fourth higher, so fret 0 is now E, fret 1 is now F, fret 2 is now F#, and so on. \n- E string: same as standard ukulele, so fret 0 is E, fret 1 is F, fret 2 is F#, and so on.\n- A string: same as standard ukulele, so fret 0 is A, fret 1 is A#, fret 2 is B, and so on.\n\n5) Putting this together, the Gb suspended fourth chord would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3   (Gb)\nE string: fret 0   (C) \nE string: fret 3   (F)\nA string: fret 0   (open)	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) The notes in an Eb major triad are Eb, G, and Bb.\n2) On a standard ukulele, these notes would be played as:\nEb: fret 1 on C string \nG: open G string\nBb: fret 3 on E string\n\n3) However, the strings on this ukulele are tuned differently. The G string is now a B string, and the C string is now an E string.\n4) So to play the Eb major triad, we need to find Eb, G, and Bb on these re-tuned strings:\nEb: fret 1 on E string (was C string)\nG: open B string (was G string) \nBb: fret 3 on E string (same as standard ukulele)\n\nPutting this together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 1\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

This gives notes D, A, E, A.\n\n2) On this special ukulele, the G string is tuned to B and the C string is tuned to E. So the notes for a D sixth chord need to be D, A, B, A.\n\n3) To get a D note, we can fret the B string at the 2nd fret. \nTo get an A note, we can play the open A string.\nTo get a B note, we can play the open E string.\n\n4) Putting this together, the fingering for a D sixth chord on this ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret X \nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we already have the B and E notes. \n4) We just need to find the F# note. The F# note is a whole step above the E note. Since each fret increases the pitch by a half step, we need to fret the E string two frets higher than the open E string.\n\nTherefore, the Bsus4 chord on your special ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 0\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the A minor seventh chord (min7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an A minor seventh chord are A, C, E and G.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord is played by fretting the C string at the first fret (for the C note), the E string at the second fret (for the E note), and leaving the G and A strings open (for the G and A notes).\n3) On your special ukulele, the G string is tuned up to B, and the C string is tuned up to E. So we need to find those notes on different strings.\n4) The E note can now be played open on the E string (the former C string). \n5) The G note can be played at the second fret on the E string (the former C string).\n6) The A and C notes remain unchanged, played open on the A and B (former G) strings respectively.\n\nPutting this together, the A minor seventh chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 2\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Gb sixth chord on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) A Gb sixth chord contains the notes Gb, Bb, Db, and Eb.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord would be played as:\nG string: fret 1 \nC string: fret 3\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret 3\n\n3) However, the strings on this ukulele are tuned differently. The G string is now a B string, and the C string is now an E string. \n4) So to play the same Gb sixth chord, we need to find the frets that correspond to Gb, Bb, Db and Eb on the B, E, E and A strings.\n5) On the B string, fret 1 is B, fret 2 is C, fret 3 is Db, so we need fret 3.\n6) On the E strings, fret 1 is E, fret 3 is Gb, so we need fret 3 on both E strings. \n7) On the A string, fret 3 is Eb, so we need fret 3.\n\nPutting this together, the Gb sixth chord on this ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret 3  \nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 3	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

A minor third down from the open B string is the 1st fret.\n5) The E string is now the C string. We need the C note, which is the open E string. \n6) The E string is still tuned to E, so we use the 3rd fret for the Eb note, same as the standard ukulele.\n7) The A string is still tuned to A, so we use the open A string for the A note, same as the standard ukulele.\n\nPutting this all together, the A diminished seventh chord on your special ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 1\nE string: fret 0  \nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we have to transpose the fingering.\n4) The Eb note can be played on the B string at the 3rd fret (B -> C -> C# -> D -> Eb)\n5) The G note can be played on the E string at the 1st fret (E -> F -> G) \n6) The Bb note can be played on the E string at the 3rd fret (E -> F -> G -> G# -> A -> Bb)\n7) The C note is still played open on the A string.\n\nPutting this together, the Eb sixth chord on your special ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3  \nE string: fret 1\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-E-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Ab suspended fourth chord (sus4) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The notes in an Ab suspended fourth chord are Ab, Db and Eb.\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned GCEA, this chord is played:\nG string: fret 1 \nC string: fret 3\nE string: fret 0 (open)\nA string: fret 0 (open)\n\n3) However, the strings on your ukulele are tuned BEEA instead. So we need to translate the frets for the Ab sus4 chord to this different tuning.\n\n4) The G string is now a B string. Fret 1 on the G string corresponds to a Ab note. So on the B string, we need to fret the string to produce an Ab note. Fret 3 on the B string will produce an Ab note.\n5) The C string is now an E string. Fret 3 on the C string corresponds to a Db note. So on the E string, we need to fret the string to produce a Db note. Fret 5 on the E string will produce a Db note. \n6) The E and A strings are unchanged, so we leave them open.\n\nPutting this together, the Ab suspended fourth chord on your ukulele tuned BEEA would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3\nE string: fret 5\nE string: fret 0 \nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

So we have to transpose the frets accordingly.\n\n4) The B string is a whole step higher than the G string. So to play Eb, we need to fret the B string at fret 3 (fret 1 on the G string transposed up 2 frets).\n5) The E string is a perfect fourth higher than the C string. So to play Bb, we need to fret the E string at fret 2 (fret 0 on the C string transposed up 2 frets). \n6) The Ab note remains the same on the E string at fret 3.\n7) The open A string also remains the same.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3  \nE string: fret 2\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) A D augmented seventh chord contains the notes D, F#, A#, and C#.\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned G-C-E-A, this chord would be played:\nG string: fret 2  (D)\nC string: fret 4 (F#)\nE string: fret 6 (A#) \nA string: fret 1 (C#)\n\n3) However, the ukulele in question has different tunings for the G and C strings:\nB string: fret ? (D)  \nE string: fret ? (F#)\nE string: fret 6 (A#) \nA string: fret 1 (C#)\n\n4) To get a D note, I would fret the B string at the 2nd fret.\n5) To get an F# note, I would fret the E string at the 4th fret.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 2\nE string: fret 4  \nE string: fret 6\nA string: fret 1	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-E-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B, and the standard C string is instead tuned to E. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the C suspended second chord (sus2) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The C suspended second chord (C sus2) contains the notes C, D, and G.\n\n2) On a standard ukulele tuned G-C-E-A, this chord is played by fretting the 2nd fret of the C string, the 2nd fret of the E string, and the 3rd fret of the A string. This gives the notes C, D, and G.\n\n3) On your ukulele tuned B-E-E-A, the B string is tuned to B, and the first E string is tuned to E. So we can get the C and E notes by playing the open B and E strings.\n\n4) To get the D note, we need to fret the 2nd fret of the E string, since each fret increases the pitch by a half note. \n\n5) The A string is unchanged, so we can play it open to get the G note.\n\nPutting this together, the C sus2 chord on your ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nE string: fret 0\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) The G suspended second chord (Gsus2) contains the notes G, A, and D.\n2) On a standard ukulele, this chord is played by fretting the C string at the second fret (D note), the E string at the second fret (G note), and leaving the G and A strings open (G and A notes).\n3) On your special ukulele, the G string is tuned to B and the C string is tuned to E. So we need to find the D, G, and A notes on different strings.\n4) The D note can be played on the E string at the second fret (since E to F is a half step, and F to G is a whole step).\n5) The G note can be played on the B string at the third fret (since B to C is a half step, C to D is a whole step, and D to E is a half step). \n6) The A note is the open A string.\n\nPutting this together, the Gsus2 chord on your special ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3  \nE string: fret 2\nE string: fret X \nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this:\n\n1) The notes in a Bb minor triad are Bb, Db, and F.\n2) On a standard ukulele, these notes correspond to:\nBb = 1st fret of G string\nDb = 1st fret of C string \nF = 3rd fret of E string\n\n3) However, on your special ukulele, the G string is tuned to B and the C string is tuned to E. So we have:\nBb = ?  (we need to find the fret that produces a Bb on the B string)\nDb = 1st fret of E string (same as standard ukulele)\nF = 3rd fret of E string (same as standard ukulele)\n\n4) To get a Bb on the B string, we need to fret the B string such that it produces a note 1 whole step lower than the open B string. Each fret lowers the pitch by a half step, so we need to go down 2 frets.\n\nTherefore, the Bb minor triad on your special ukulele would be:\n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 2  \nE string: fret 1\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret X	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
