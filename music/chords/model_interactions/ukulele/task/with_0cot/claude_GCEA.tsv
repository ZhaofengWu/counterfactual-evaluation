Db is a whole step above C, so we need to fret the G string at the 2nd fret.\n4) To play an F, we need to fret the C string. F is 3 half steps above C, so we need to fret the C string at the 1st fret.\n5) To play an Ab, we need to fret the E string. Ab is 3 half steps above E, so we need to fret the E string at the 1st fret. \n6) To play a C, we can play the open A string.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nANSWER: \nG string: fret 2  \nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret X\n\nSo to play a Db dominant seventh chord on a standard ukulele, fret the G string at the 2nd fret, the C string at the 1st fret, the E string at the 1st fret and play the open A string.

You are an expert ukulele player. I have a ukulele with standard strings G-C-E-A.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Gb suspended second chord (sus2) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nG string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Okay, let's think through this step by step:\n\n1) A Gb suspended second chord (Gb sus2) contains the notes Gb, Ab and C.\n2) On a standard ukulele with G-C-E-A tuning, the notes Gb, Ab and C correspond to the first, third and fourth strings respectively.\n3) Fretting the first string at the 1st fret produces a Gb note. \n4) Fretting the third string at the 3rd fret produces a C note.\n5) The fourth string is already tuned to a C note, so we leave it open.\n6) We do not play the second string for this chord.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nANSWER: \nG string: fret 1 \nC string: fret X\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 0	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1
