Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Eb dominant seventh chord (dom7) is made up of the notes Eb, G, Bb, and D. On a standard ukulele, the Eb dom7 chord is played as follows:\n\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 2\nE string: fret 1\nA string: fret 0\n\nHowever, on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A, the Eb dom7 chord is played as follows:\n\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 0\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 1\n\nThis is because the B string on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A is tuned to the note B, which is the same note as the Eb string on a standard ukulele. Similarly, the E string on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A is tuned to the note E, which is the same note as the C string on a standard ukulele. Therefore, the Eb dom7 chord on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A is played by using the same fingering as the Eb dom7 chord on a standard ukulele, but with the B string and E string swapped.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Db suspended second chord (sus2) is made up of the notes D, F, and A. On a standard ukulele, the notes D, F, and A are played on the 2nd, 4th, and 5th strings, respectively. On a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A, the notes D, F, and A are played on the 4th, 6th, and 7th strings, respectively. Therefore, the Db suspended second chord (sus2) on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 4\nE string: fret 6\nE string: fret 7\nA string: fret X	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the B dominant seventh chord (dom7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	The Db major triad consists of the notes D, F#, and A. On a standard ukulele, these notes are played on the following strings and frets:\n\n* D string: fret 5\n* G string: fret 4\n* C string: fret 3\n* E string: fret 2\n\nOn a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A, the notes D, F#, and A are played on the following strings and frets:\n\n* B string: fret 0\n* E string: fret 2\n* E string: fret 4\n* A string: fret 5\n\nTherefore, the Db major triad on a ukulele tuned to B-E-E-A is played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 0\nE string: fret 2\nE string: fret 4\nA string: fret 5	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
