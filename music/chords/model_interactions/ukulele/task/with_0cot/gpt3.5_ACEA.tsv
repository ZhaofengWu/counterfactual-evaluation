Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an F suspended second chord. It consists of the notes F, G, and C. \n\nNext, let's figure out where those notes are on our ukulele with the A-C-E-A tuning. \n\n- The A string is already tuned to an A note, so we don't need to change anything there. \n- The C string is still tuned to a C note, so we'll need to figure out where the G note is on that string. We can find it on the 5th fret. \n- The E string is still tuned to an E note, so we'll need to figure out where the C note is on that string. We can find it on the 4th fret. \n- The A string is already tuned to an A note, so we don't need to change anything there. \n\nNow that we know where the F, G, and C notes are on our ukulele, we can put them together to form the F suspended second chord. \n\nANSWER: \nA string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 5 \nE string: fret 4 \nA string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Step 1: Identify the notes in the Gb major triad. The Gb major triad consists of the notes Gb, Bb, and Db.\n\nStep 2: Determine the positions of these notes on the ukulele. On a standard ukulele tuned to G-C-E-A, the Gb note would be played on the 2nd fret of the C string, the Bb note would be played on the 1st fret of the A string, and the Db note would be played on the 4th fret of the E string.\n\nStep 3: Translate these positions to the ukulele with strings tuned to A-C-E-A. Since the A string is tuned to what is normally the G string, we can play the Gb note on the open A string. The Bb note can be played on the 1st fret of the C string, the same as on a standard ukulele. The Db note can be played on the 4th fret of the E string, the same as on a standard ukulele.\n\nANSWER: \nA string: fret 0\nC string: fret 1\nE string: fret 4\nA string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an Eb sus2 chord: Eb, F, Bb. \n\nSince our ukulele is tuned differently, we need to figure out where these notes are on our strings. \n\nThe A string is now our lowest string, and it is already tuned to A. So we can use it to play the Eb note. \n\nNext, we need to find the F note. On a standard ukulele, this would be played on the first fret of the E string. However, on our ukulele, the E string is tuned to C. So we need to find the F note on the C string instead. \n\nTo play an F note on the C string, we need to fret the third fret. \n\nFinally, we need to find the Bb note. On a standard ukulele, this would be played on the first fret of the A string. However, on our ukulele, the A string is already being used to play the Eb note. \n\nSo instead, we can play the Bb note on the E string, which is still tuned to E. To do this, we need to fret the first fret. \n\nPutting it all together, our answer is: \n\nANSWER: \nA string: fret 6 \nC string: fret 3 \nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We need to find the fret that corresponds to B. Using a ukulele chord chart or a tuner, we can see that B is on the 4th fret of the A string. \n\n- D: We can play D on the C string, which is still tuned to C. We need to find the fret that corresponds to D. Using the same resources, we can see that D is on the 2nd fret of the C string. \n\n- F: We can play F on the E string, which is still tuned to E. We need to find the fret that corresponds to F. Using the same resources, we can see that F is on the 1st fret of the E string. \n\n- Ab: We can play Ab on the A string again, but this time on a higher fret.

You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to A-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to A. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the G major triad on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nA string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	Step 1: Identify the notes in a G major triad - G, B, D.\n\nStep 2: Determine where these notes are located on the A-C-E-A tuning. \n\n- G is normally played on the third fret of the E string, but since the E string is now tuned to A, we will play it on the third fret of the A string instead.\n- B is normally played on the second fret of the A string, which is now tuned to C. We will play it on the fourth fret of the C string instead.\n- D is normally played on the second fret of the C string, which is still tuned to C. We will play it on the second fret of the E string instead.\n\nStep 3: Put it all together.\n\nANSWER: \nA string: fret 3\nC string: fret 4\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret 0 (open)	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Ab augmented seventh chord (aug7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nA string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an Ab augmented seventh chord: Ab, C, E, and G#. \n\nSince our ukulele is tuned to A-C-E-A, we already have the A and C notes covered. \n\nTo play the E note, we can play the open E string. \n\nTo play the G# note, we can use the A string and fret it at the 4th fret, which is one half note higher than the 3rd fret (which would give us a G note). \n\nSo, our final answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nA string: fret 4\nC string: fret X\nE string: fret 0\nA string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
