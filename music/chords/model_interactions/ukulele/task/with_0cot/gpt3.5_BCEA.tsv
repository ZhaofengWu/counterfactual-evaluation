You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the E minor seventh chord (min7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in an E minor seventh chord: E, G, B, and D.\n\nSince our ukulele is tuned differently, we need to figure out where these notes are on our strings.\n\n- The B string is already tuned to B, so we don't need to do anything there.\n- The C string is still tuned to C, which is two half steps higher than B. So to get to D, we need to fret the C string at the second fret.\n- The E string is still tuned to E, which is three half steps higher than C. So to get to G, we need to fret the E string at the third fret.\n- The A string is still tuned to A, which is five half steps higher than E. So to get to E, we need to fret the A string at the fifth fret.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 0\nC string: fret 2\nE string: fret 3\nA string: fret 5	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a B major triad: B, D#, and F#. \n\nTo play B on this ukulele, we need to play the B string, which is already tuned to B. So we don't need to fret anything on that string.\n\nTo play D#, we need to find the note on the C string. Since the C string is tuned to C, we need to fret it up two half steps to get to D#. Therefore, we need to fret the C string on the second fret.\n\nTo play F#, we need to find the note on the E string. Since the E string is tuned to E, we need to fret it up four half steps to get to F#. Therefore, we need to fret the E string on the fourth fret.\n\nFinally, we don't need to play the A string for this triad, so we can leave it open.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 0\nC string: fret 2\nE string: fret 4\nA string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a Db diminished seventh chord. It consists of the notes Db, Fb (which is the same as E), Abb (which is the same as G), and Cbb (which is the same as B). \n\nNext, let's figure out where these notes are on our ukulele with the B-C-E-A tuning. \n\n- Db: We don't have a Db note on our ukulele, but we can use its enharmonic equivalent, C#. This note is located on the 4th fret of the A string. \n- Fb/E: This note is located on the 2nd fret of the E string. \n- Abb/G: This note is located on the 1st fret of the C string. \n- Cbb/B: This note is located on the open B string. \n\nNow that we know where each note is located, we can put them together to form the Db diminished seventh chord. \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 0 \nC string: fret 1 \nE string: fret 2 \nA string: fret 4	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The C major triad consists of the notes C, E, and G.\n\nNext, we need to figure out where these notes are on our ukulele with the B-C-E-A tuning.\n\nThe B string is now our equivalent of the G string in standard tuning. To play a C note on the B string, we need to fret the string at the first fret. So, B string: fret 1.\n\nThe C string is still the C string in standard tuning. To play an E note on the C string, we need to fret the string at the third fret. So, C string: fret 3.\n\nThe E string is still the E string in standard tuning. To play a G note on the E string, we need to fret the string at the second fret. So, E string: fret 2.\n\nThe A string is still the A string in standard tuning.

So we'll play the B string on the second fret. \n\nTo play an F on the C string, we need to go up three frets from the C string's open note (which is actually an E). So we'll play the C string on the third fret. \n\nTo play an Ab on the E string, we need to go up four frets from the E string's open note (which is actually an A). So we'll play the E string on the fourth fret. \n\nTo play a Cb on the A string, we need to go up one fret from the A string's open note (which is actually a D).

All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the G diminished seventh chord (dim7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a G diminished seventh chord: G, Bb, Db, and Fb (which is enharmonically equivalent to E). \n\nNext, let's figure out where these notes are on our ukulele with the B-C-E-A tuning. \n\n- G is now on the B string (which used to be the G string). \n- Bb is not in our tuning, so we'll have to use an enharmonic equivalent. A# is the same note as Bb, and it's on the A string. \n- Db is on the C string. \n- Fb/E is on the E string. \n\nNow we need to figure out which frets to play these notes on. \n\n- For G on the B string, we'll play fret 3. \n- For A# on the A string, we'll play fret 1. \n- For Db on the C string, we'll play fret 2. \n- For Fb/E on the E string, we'll play fret 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 3 \nC string: fret 2 \nE string: fret 1 \nA string: fret 1	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

G# is located on the 4th fret of the E string. \n\nNow that we know where each note is located on our ukulele, we can put them together to form the Db suspended second chord. \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret 2 \nC string: fret 4 \nE string: fret 4 \nA string: fret 0	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert ukulele player. I have a special ukulele with strings tuned to B-C-E-A instead of the standard G-C-E-A. Note that what is the standard G string is instead tuned to B. All other strings are the same.\n\nI want you to tell me how I could play the Gb minor seventh chord (min7) on this ukulele.\n\nMake sure to choose one final answer, which you should start with 'ANSWER:' and specify in the following format: \n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret FRET\nC string: fret FRET\nE string: fret FRET\nA string: fret FRET\n\nUse fret 0 to indicate an open string and fret X to indicate not playing a string. Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, let's identify the notes in a Gb minor seventh chord. \n\nThe notes in a Gb minor seventh chord are Gb, Bbb (which is the same as A), Db, and Fb (which is the same as E). \n\nNext, let's figure out where these notes are on our ukulele with the B-C-E-A tuning. \n\n- Gb is not in our tuning, but we can use the note Bb instead, which is one half step lower. \n- Bbb (A) is on the A string, fret 1. \n- Db is on the C string, fret 4. \n- Fb (E) is on the E string, fret 2. \n\nNow we can put it all together: \n\nANSWER: \nB string: fret X \nC string: fret 4 \nE string: fret 2 \nA string: fret 1	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Each increase in fret corresponds to an increase in half a note.\n\nLet's think step by step.	First, we need to know the notes in a G major triad. The notes are G, B, and D.\n\nNext, we need to figure out where these notes are on our ukulele with the non-standard tuning. \n\nThe G note is now on the B string, so we can play an open B string to get the G note.\n\nThe B note is now on the C string, so we need to find the B note on the C string. We can play the second fret on the C string to get the B note.\n\nThe D note is still on the E string, so we can play the second fret on the E string to get the D note.\n\nSo, the G major triad on this ukulele would be played as follows:\n\nANSWER:\nB string: fret 0\nC string: fret 2\nE string: fret 2\nA string: fret X	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
