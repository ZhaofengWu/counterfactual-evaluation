You are an expert in linguistics. Imagine a language that is the same as English only except that it uses the object-subject-verb order instead of the subject-verb-object order. Your task is to reconstruct the original sentence in English. You should only use the words in the same form as they appear in the given sentence.\nSentence: emily bob calls.\nLet's think step by step. Show the original sentence at the end with the prefix 'Original sentence: '.\n	First, we need to identify the subject, verb, and object in the given sentence. In this case, "Emily" is the subject, "calls" is the verb, and "Bob" is the object. \n\nNext, we need to rearrange the words in the correct order for English, which is subject-verb-object. So, the reconstructed sentence would be "Emily calls Bob."\n\nOriginal sentence: Bob calls Emily.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Show the original sentence at the end with the prefix 'Original sentence: '.\n	First, we need to identify the subject, object, and verb in the given sentence. In this case, "Noah" and "Tom" are both nouns, so they cannot be the verb. "Loves" is a verb, so it must come last in the sentence. Therefore, "Noah" and "Tom" must be the subject and object, but we don't know which is which.\n\nTo determine the subject and object, we can try switching the order of "Noah" and "Tom" and see which one makes more sense. If we say "Tom Noah loves," it doesn't make much sense, so we can assume that "Noah" is the subject and "Tom" is the object.\n\nNow we can reconstruct the sentence in English using the subject-verb-object order: "Noah loves Tom."\n\nOriginal sentence: Noah loves Tom.
