Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the digits in the ones place: A + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 10 = 20 in base-10. To convert this back to base-11, we have 20 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 9. So, we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the tens place: 8 + 8 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 8 + 8 + 1 = 17.

In base-10, this would be 11, but since we are in base-11, this is represented as 10. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 3 + 2. In base-10, this would be 6. Since 6 is within the range of base-11 digits, we don't need to carry over anything.\n\nSo, the result is 60 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{60}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are in base-11, we need to convert 14 to base-11. To do this, we divide 14 by 11 and find that it is equal to 1 with a remainder of 3. So, in base-11, 14 is represented as 13.\n\nNow, we combine the results from the two columns: 13 in the 11's place and 7 in the 1's place. This gives us the final result of 137 in base-11.\n\nSo, 91 + 56 in base-11 is \\boxed{137}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's convert the numbers A6 and 21 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, A6 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (6 * 11^0) = 110 + 6 = 116 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 21 from base-11 to base-10. This is equal to (2 * 11^1) + (1 * 11^0) = 22 + 1 = 23 in base-10.\n\nNow, we can add the two numbers in base-10: 116 + 23 = 139.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 139. This is 11^1 = 11, and 139 divided by 11 is 12 with a remainder of 7.

Then, we find how many times 11 can fit into 119, which is 10 times (with a remainder). So, the coefficient for the 11^1 place is "A" (which represents 10 in base-11).\n\nNow, we have a remainder of 119 - (10 * 11) = 9.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A3+15? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers A3 and 15 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equal to 10 in base-10. So, A3 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (3 * 11^0) = 110 + 3 = 113 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 15 from base-11 to base-10. This is equal to (1 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0) = 11 + 5 = 16 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 113 + 16 = 129.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 129. This is 11^1 = 11. \n\nNow, we divide 129 by 11: 129 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 8. So, the coefficient for 11^1 is 1.\n\nNext, we consider the remainder, which is 8. Since 8 is less than 11, the coefficient for 11^0 is 8.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 18.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 9 + 7.\n\nSince 9 + 7 = 16 in base-10, we need to convert it to base-11. 16 in base-10 is equal to 15 in base-11, which can be written as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0).\n\nNow, we carry over the 1 to the next column (tens place) and add the remaining digits: 1 (carried over) + 7 + 5.\n\n1 + 7 + 5 = 13 in base-10. To convert it to base-11, we see that 13 in base-10 is equal to 12 in base-11, which can be written as 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0, or simply 12.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A (from the units place) and 12 (from the tens place), which gives us \\boxed{12A} in base-11.

First, let's break down the numbers 9A and 63 into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n9A in base-11 means (9 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = (9 * 11) + (10 * 1) = 99 + 10 = 109 in base-10.\n\n63 in base-11 means (6 * 11^1) + (3 * 11^0) = (6 * 11) + (3 * 1) = 66 + 3 = 69 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two base-10 numbers: 109 + 69 = 178.\n\nNow, we need to convert 178 back to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 178 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 178 \xf7 11 = 16 with a remainder of 2. This means 178 = (16 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0).\n\n2. Now, we need to represent 16 in base-11. Since 16 is less than 11^2, we know it will be a two-digit number in base-11. Divide 16 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 16 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 5. This means 16 = (1 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0).\n\nSo, 178 in base-10 is equivalent to 152 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, 9A + 63 in base-11 is \\boxed{152}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A7+AA? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-11, the digits are 0123456789A, where A represents 10 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add A7 and AA in base-11:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ AA\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 7 + A. Since A represents 10 in base-10, we have 7 + 10 = 17 in base-10. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16 (1 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0). So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  A7\n+ AA\n-----\n   6\n```\n\nNow, let's add the next digits, A and A, along with the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 10 + 10 + 1 = 21. In base-11, 21 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we write down the 1A:\n\n```\n  1\n  A7\n+ AA\n-----\n 1A6\n```\n\nSo, A7 + AA in base-11 is \\boxed{1A6}.

First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier.\n\n6A in base-11 means 6 * 11^1 + A * 11^0 = 6 * 11 + 10 = 66 + 10 = 76 in base-10.\n\n2A in base-11 means 2 * 11^1 + A * 11^0 = 2 * 11 + 10 = 22 + 10 = 32 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 76 + 32 = 108.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 108 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 108 \xf7 11 = 9 with a remainder of 9.\n2. Since the quotient is less than 11, we can stop here.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 99. Therefore, 6A + 2A in base-11 is \\boxed{99}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A4 and 36 in base-11, we'll start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 6.\n\n4 + 6 = 10 in base-10, which is equal to A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digits, which are A and 3.\n\n1 + A + 3 = 1 + 10 + 3 = 14 in base-10. Since 14 is greater than 10, we need to convert it to base-11.\n\n14 in base-10 is equal to 11 * 1 + 3, which is 13 in base-11. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digits, which are just 1 in this case.\n\n1 = 1 in base-11.\n\nSo, the final result is 13A in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{13A}.

Since 3 + 5 = 8, we don't need to carry over any value. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 8.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11s place): 6 + 8. Since 6 + 8 = 14, we need to carry over the value of 1 to the next place (the 121s place) because 14 is greater than the base-11 maximum digit A (which is equivalent to 10 in base-10).\n\nSo, we have a 1 in the 121s place, a 4 in the 11s place, and an 8 in the 1s place.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n0 + A\n\nSince A in base-11 represents the value 10 in base-10, we have:\n\n0 + 10\n\nThis equals 10, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (tens place) and write down the 0:\n\n1\n50\n+9A\n-----\n  0\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place), including the carried-over 1:\n\n1 + 5 + 9\n\nThis equals 15. Since 15 is still within the range of base-11 (which goes up to 10*11 = 110), we can simply write down the 15 as "E" in base-11:\n\n  1\n 50\n+9A\n-----\n E0\n\nSo, 50 + 9A in base-11 is equal to E0 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{E0}.

First, let's add the numbers in the ones place: 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place: 9 + 4 = 13. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we carry over the 1 and write down A.\n\nAdding the carried-over 1 to the result, we get: 1A5.\n\nSo, 93 + 42 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A5}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 55+7A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1's place): 5 + A. Since A in base-11 represents the value 10 in base-10, we have 5 + 10 = 15 in base-10. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14, so we write down a 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11's place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 7 + 1. In base-10, this is 5 + 7 + 1 = 13. In base-11, 13 is represented as 12, so we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next place (the 121's place).\n\nSo, the final result is 124 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{124}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier. \n\nIn base-11, the number 12 represents 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 11 + 2 = 13 in base-10.\n\nThe number A0 in base-11 represents 10 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 110 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers: 13 + 110 = 123.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. \n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 123 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 123 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 2. This means that there are 11 sets of 11 in 123, with 2 left over.\n\n2. Write down the remainder (2) as the rightmost digit of the base-11 number.\n\n3. Divide the quotient (11) by 11 again: 11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n\n4. Write down the remainder (0) as the next digit to the left in the base-11 number.\n\n5. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, we can stop dividing and write down the quotient as the leftmost digit of the base-11 number.\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of the sum is 102.\n\nTherefore, 12 + A0 in base-11 is \\boxed{102}.

In base-11, this is equivalent to 10, which we write as "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 9 + 1. In base-11, this is equivalent to 17, which we write as "16" (1 in the tens place and 6 in the units place).\n\nSo, the final result is 16A. Therefore, the sum of 74 and 96 in base-11 is \\boxed{16A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To do this, we'll find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 123, which is 11^1 = 11. Then, we'll divide 123 by 11 to find out how many times 11 can fit into 123.\n\n123 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 2. So, we have 11 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0.\n\nNow, let's convert this back into base-11 notation. The coefficient of 11^1 is 11, which is represented by the digit "A" in base-11. The coefficient of 11^0 is 2, which is represented by the digit "2" in base-11.\n\nSo, the final result is \\boxed{A2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 10 with the digit "A".\n\nSo, the sum of 61 and 47 in base-11 is A8.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{A8}.

In base-10, this would be 11, but we need to convert it to base-11. Since 11 is equal to 10 in base-11, we write down an A.\n\nSo, the result of 67 + 45 in base-11 is \\boxed{A1}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1s place): 6 + 7.\n\nIn base-11, we have the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and A. Since 6 + 7 = 13 in base-10, we need to convert this to base-11. We know that 11 + 2 = 13, so in base-11, 6 + 7 = 12. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 3 + 4.\n\nIn base-10, 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. Since 8 is a valid digit in base-11, we don't need to convert anything here.\n\nSo, combining the results from both columns, we get the final answer: \\boxed{82}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers A1 and 78 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA1 in base-11 means (10 * 11^1) + (1 * 11^0) = 110 + 1 = 111 in base-10.\n\n78 in base-11 means (7 * 11^1) + (8 * 11^0) = 77 + 8 = 85 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 111 + 85 = 196.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11:\n\n196 \xf7 11 = 17 with a remainder of 9, so the last digit is 9.\n\n17 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 6, so the next digit is 6.\n\nThus, the result in base-11 is 169.\n\nSo, A1 + 78 in base-11 is \\boxed{169}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n0 + 3 = 3\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place):\n\n7 + 3 = A (since 10 in base-11 is represented by A)\n\nSo, the result is A3.\n\nTherefore, 70 + 33 in base-11 is \\boxed{A3}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 83+34? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1s place): 3 + 4. Since 3 + 4 = 7, we can write a 7 in the 1s place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (the 11s place): 8 + 3. Since 8 + 3 = 11, we have a carry-over situation. In base-11, 11 is represented as 10, so we write a 0 in the 11s place of the sum and carry over a 1 to the next column (the 121s place).\n\nSince there are no more digits in the original numbers, we simply write the carried-over 1 in the 121s place of the sum.\n\nSo, the final sum is 107 in base-11. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{107}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n5 + 1 = 6\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place):\n\n6 + 7 = 13\n\nSince we are working in base-11, we need to convert 13 to base-11. To do this, we divide 13 by 11:\n\n13 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 2\n\nSo, 13 in base-11 is represented as 12. Now, we can combine the results from the tens and units places:\n\n12 (in base-11) and 6\n\nThe final result is:\n\n\\boxed{126}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 94+A8? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  94\n+A8\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 4 + 8. In base-11, this would be 12, which means we carry over 1 and write down 2:\n\n```\n  1\n  94\n+A8\n-----\n  2\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 1 (carried over) + 9 + A. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 1 + 9 + 10 = 20. Since 20 is greater than the base, we need to carry over again. In base-11, 20 is represented as 1A, so we carry over 1 and write down A:\n\n```\n 1\n  94\n+A8\n-----\n 1A2\n```\n\nFinally, we have 1 (carried over) + 0 (since there are no more digits to add). This gives us:\n\n```\n  94\n+A8\n-----\n\\boxed{1A2}\n```\n\nSo, 94 + A8 in base-11 is equal to 1A2.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 44 and 88 into their place values in base-11.\n\n44 in base-11 is (4 * 11^1) + (4 * 11^0) = 44 + 4 = 48 in base-10.\n\n88 in base-11 is (8 * 11^1) + (8 * 11^0) = 88 + 8 = 96 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 48 + 96 = 144.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 144 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 144 \xf7 11 = 13 with a remainder of 1. This means that there is a 1 in the 11^0 place.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (13) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 13 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 2. This means that there is a 2 in the 11^1 place.\n\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, we have reached the end of the conversion process. There is a 1 in the 11^2 place.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 121.\n\nTherefore, 44 + 88 in base-11 is \\boxed{121}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To do this, we'll divide by the highest power of 11 that is less than or equal to the result and find the remainder:\n\n226 \xf7 11^2 = 226 \xf7 121 = 1 remainder 105 (since 121 > 226, we know that the quotient is 1)\n\nNow, we'll divide the remainder by the next lower power of 11:\n\n105 \xf7 11^1 = 105 \xf7 11 = 9 remainder 6\n\nFinally, we'll divide the remainder by 11^0:\n\n6 \xf7 11^0 = 6 \xf7 1 = 6\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 196. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{196}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 29+22?

First, let's rewrite the numbers in base-11: 29 is written as 2A (2*11^1 + 10*11^0) and 22 is written as 20 (2*11^1 + 0*11^0).\n\nNow, let's add the numbers:\n\n  2A\n+20\n-----\nTo add these numbers, we start from the rightmost digit. A (10 in base-10) plus 0 is still A. Now, we move to the next digit. 2 plus 2 is 4. So, the result is:\n\n  4A\n\nThus, the sum of 29 and 22 in base-11 is \\boxed{4A}.

So, the first digit is 3.\n\n11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0. So, the second digit is 0.\n\nTherefore, 18 + 96 in base-11 is equal to 103 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{103}.

In base-11, the number 11 is equal to 1*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 11 + 1 = 12 in base-10. The number 7A in base-11 is equal to 7*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 77 + 10 = 87 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers: 12 + 87 = 99.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier. In base-11, the number 4A represents 4*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 44 + 10 = 54 in base-10. Similarly, the number 9A represents 9*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 99 + 10 = 109 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 54 + 109 = 163.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 163 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 163 \xf7 11 = 14 with a remainder of 9. This means that there are 14 groups of 11 in 163, with 9 left over.\n2. Write down the remainder (9) as the rightmost digit of the base-11 number.\n3. Divide the quotient (14) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 14 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 3. This means that there is 1 group of 11 in 14, with 3 left over.\n4. Write down the remainder (3) as the next digit to the left in the base-11 number.\n5. Since the new quotient (1) is less than 11, write it down as the leftmost digit of the base-11 number.\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of 163 is 139.

Since 6 + 7 = 13, which is greater than 11, we need to carry over. 13 in base-11 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + A * 11^0 = 11 + 10 = 13). So, we carry over the 1 and write down A in the tens place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the hundreds place, A in the tens place, and 7 in the ones place.

First, let's convert the numbers 17 and 59 from base-11 to base-10.\n\n17 in base-11 is equal to (1 \xd7 11^1) + (7 \xd7 11^0) = 11 + 7 = 18 in base-10.\n\n59 in base-11 is equal to (5 \xd7 11^1) + (9 \xd7 11^0) = 55 + 9 = 64 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 18 + 64 = 82.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11:\n\n82 \xf7 11 = 7 with a remainder of 5.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 41+96? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1's place): 1 + 6. Since we are in base-11, this addition is the same as in base-10, so 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (the 11's place): 4 + 9. In base-10, this would be 4 + 9 = 13. However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 13 in base-11. To do this, we divide 13 by 11 and find that it is equal to 1 remainder 2. So, in base-11, 13 is represented as 12.\n\nNow, we combine the results from the two columns: 12 in the 11's place and 7 in the 1's place. This gives us the final result in base-11: \\boxed{127}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 52 and 92 in base-11.\n\n52 in base-11 means (5 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 55 + 2 = 57 in base-10.\n\n92 in base-11 means (9 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 99 + 2 = 101 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 57 + 101 = 158.\n\nNow, we need to convert 158 back to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 158, which is 11^1 = 11. We can fit 11^1 into 158 fourteen (14) times, so the coefficient for 11^1 is 14. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to represent 14 as 13 + 1, which in base-11 is A + 1. So, the coefficient for 11^1 is A.\n\nNow, we subtract (A * 11^1) from 158 to find the remainder: 158 - (A * 11^1) = 158 - (13 * 11) = 158 - 143 = 15.\n\nThe largest power of 11 less than or equal to 15 is 11^0 = 1. We can fit 11^0 into 15 fifteen (15) times, so the coefficient for 11^0 is 15. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to represent 15 as 13 + 2, which in base-11 is A + 2. So, the coefficient for 11^0 is A.\n\nSo, the final result in base-11 is A2.\n\nTherefore, 52 + 92 in base-11 is \\boxed{A2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's break down the numbers 28 and 99 in base-11.\n\n28 in base-11 is equal to (2 \xd7 11^1) + (8 \xd7 11^0) = 22 + 8 = 30 in base-10.\n\n99 in base-11 is equal to (9 \xd7 11^1) + (9 \xd7 11^0) = 99 + 9 = 108 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these base-10 numbers: 30 + 108 = 138.\n\nNow, we need to convert 138 back to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 138 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 138 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 6. This means that there is a 6 in the 11^0 place.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (12) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 12 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 1. This means that there is a 1 in the 11^1 place.\n\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, we have reached the end of our conversion. The final base-11 number is 16.\n\nSo, 28 + 99 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{16} in base-11.

Since 6 + 4 = 10 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column in base-11. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 5 + 1. Since 7 + 5 + 1 = 13 in base-10, we need to represent 13 in base-11. 13 in base-11 is equal to 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0, which is written as 12.\n\nSo, the sum of 76 and 54 in base-11 is \\boxed{120}.

So, the 11^1 place value is 5.\n\n15 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 4. So, the 11^2 place value is 4.\n\nThus, 170 in base-10 is 458 in base-11.\n\nSo, 58 + 98 in base-11 is \\boxed{458}.

Since we are in base-11, 11 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 6 + 4 = 11. Again, 11 is represented as 10 in base-11. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next place.\n\nSo, the final result is 100 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, 65 + 46 in base-11 is \\boxed{100}.

Since we are in base-11, this addition does not require any carrying over, so the result is simply 2.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the tens place: 3 + 9. This sum is 12 in base-10, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11 (since A represents 10 in base-11).

To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 189 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 189 \xf7 11 = 17 with a remainder of 2. This means that there are 17 groups of 11 in 189, with 2 left over.\n\n2. Write down the remainder (2) as the rightmost digit of the base-11 number.\n\n3.

Write down the remainder (6) as the next digit to the left in the base-11 number.\n\n5. Since the new quotient (1) is less than 11, we can write it down as the leftmost digit of the base-11 number.\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of 189 is 162.\n\nTherefore, A6 + 67 in base-11 is \\boxed{162}.

To do this, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 129. This is 11^1 = 11. \n\nNow, we divide 129 by 11: 129 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 8.

The rightmost digit of the sum is 14 - 11 = 3.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: 1 (from 1A) and 7 (from 74) plus the carry-over of 1. In base-10, this would be 1 + 7 + 1 = 9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place): 7 + 6 = 13. Since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1A (1*11^1 + 10*11^0). So, we carry over the 1 and write down A in the tens place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1A in the tens place and 5 in the units place, so the sum is \\boxed{1A5}.

We write down the "A" and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 5 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than the base-11 maximum digit "A", we need to carry over again. 12 in base-11 is represented as 10, so we write down the "1" and carry over the other "1".\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carried-over "1" in the next place (the 121s place).\n\nSo, the final result is 1A1 in base-11.

Since we are in base-11, we write down the digit 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (the 11's place) along with the carry-over: 8 + A + 1. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so the sum is 8 + 10 + 1 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 10, we need to carry over again. We write down the digit 8 (19 - 11 = 8) and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the leftmost column, which is just 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 86 and A6 in base-11 is 1A8.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n4 + 9 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 11 + 2 = 13).

In base-11, 70 represents 7 * 11^1, and A0 represents A * 11^1. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we can rewrite A0 as 10 * 11^1.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers:\n\n7 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^1 = (7 + 10) * 11^1 = 17 * 11^1\n\nSince 17 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over the excess to the next place value.

First, let's convert the numbers A5 and 65 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA5 in base-11 means (10 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0) = (10 * 11) + (5 * 1) = 110 + 5 = 115 in base-10.\n\n65 in base-11 means (6 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0) = (6 * 11) + (5 * 1) = 66 + 5 = 71 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 115 + 71 = 186.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 186 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   186 \xf7 11 = 16 with a remainder of 10.\n\n2.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1's place): A + 9. In base-11, A represents 10. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we need to carry over the extra value. 19 in base-11 is 18, so we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (the 11's place): 8 + 3 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 8 + 3 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 11, we need to carry over the extra value. 12 in base-11 is 11, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we have 1 in the 121's place (from the carry-over).

First, let's break down the numbers 91 and 51 into their place values in base-11.\n\n91 = 9 * 11^1 + 1 * 11^0 = 99 + 1\n51 = 5 * 11^1 + 1 * 11^0 = 55 + 1\n\nNow, let's add the numbers together:\n\n(99 + 1) + (55 + 1) = 99 + 55 + 1 + 1 = 154 + 2 = 156\n\nNow, we need to convert 156 back into base-11. To do this, we'll find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 156, which is 11^1 = 11. Then, we'll divide 156 by 11:\n\n156 \xf7 11 = 14 R 2\n\nThis means that there are 14 groups of 11 in 156, with a remainder of 2. So, we can represent 156 as:\n\n14 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0\n\nNow, we need to convert the coefficients (14 and 2) into base-11 digits. Since 14 is greater than the highest base-11 digit (A), we need to break it down further:\n\n14 \xf7 11 = 1 R 3\n\nThis means that there is 1 group of 11 in 14, with a remainder of 3. So, we can represent 14 as:\n\n1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0\n\nNow, we can combine this with the previous representation of 156:\n\n(1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0) * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0\n\nFinally, we can write this in base-11 notation:\n\n13 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 132\n\nSo, 91 + 51 in base-11 is \\boxed{132}.

First, let's convert the numbers A2 and 86 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA2 in base-11 means (10 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 110 + 2 = 112 in base-10.\n\n86 in base-11 means (8 * 11^1) + (6 * 11^0) = 88 + 6 = 94 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 112 + 94 = 206.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11:\n\n206 \xf7 11 = 18 with a remainder of 8, so the digit in the 11^1 place is 8.\n\n18 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 7, so the digit in the 11^2 place is 1.\n\nThus, the result in base-11 is 178.\n\nSo, A2 + 86 in base-11 is \\boxed{178}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 6 + 3. In base-11, this addition is straightforward: 6 + 3 = 9. So, we write down a 9 in the units place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (tens place): 4 + 8. In base-11, this addition is also straightforward: 4 + 8 = 12. However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-11, 12 is represented as 10 + 2, or "12" = "10" + "2". So, we write down a 2 in the tens place of the result and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we simply write down the carried-over 1 in the next place (hundreds place) of the result.\n\nPutting it all together, we have: 1 in the hundreds place, 2 in the tens place, and 9 in the units place.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 15 in base-11. \n\n15 in base-10 is equal to 1 * 11^1 + 4 * 11^0 in base-11, which is written as 14 in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum of 93 and 62 in base-11 is 145.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{145}.

In base-11, this would be:\n\n8 + 9 = 17 (in base-10)\n\nSince 17 in base-10 is equal to 16 in base-11, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 9 + A. In base-11, A represents 10 in base-10. So, we have:\n\n1 + 9 + 10 = 20 (in base-10)\n\nSince 20 in base-10 is equal to 18 in base-11, we write down the 8 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 0.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A3 and A7 in base-11, we can follow the same process as in base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum is greater than or equal to 11.\n\nStarting with the rightmost digit, we have 3 + 7 = 10. Since 10 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 0.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost digit. We have A + A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, we have 10 + 10 = 20. Since 20 is greater than or equal to 11, we need to carry over. We can subtract 11 from 20 to get 9, and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carried-over 1 in the next place value.\n\nSo, the sum of A3 and A7 in base-11 is 190.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{190}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): A + 3. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 3 = 13. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1(11^1) + 2(11^0), which is written as "12". So, we write down the "2" and carry over the "1".\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (11s place) along with the carry-over: 8 + A + 1. In base-10, this is 8 + 10 + 1 = 19.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  5A\n+ 67\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have A + 7. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 7 = 17. Since 17 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. 17 in base-11 is 16, so we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have 5 + 6 + the carried over 1, which is 5 + 6 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to represent it in base-11. 12 in base-11 is 1A, so we write down the A and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we write down the carried over 1 in the next column to the left.\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n```\n 1\n  5A\n+ 67\n-----\n 1A6\n```\n\nTherefore, 5A + 67 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A6}.

First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier. \n\nThe number 13 in base-11 is equal to (1 \xd7 11^1) + (3 \xd7 11^0) = 11 + 3 = 14 in base-10.\n\nThe number A0 in base-11 is equal to (10 \xd7 11^1) + (0 \xd7 11^0) = 110 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers: 14 + 110 = 124.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. \n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 124 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 124 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 3. So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 3.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (11) by 11 again: 11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0. So, the next digit to the left is 0.\n\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, we have reached the most significant digit (leftmost digit), which is 1.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the base-11 number 103.\n\nSo, 13 + A0 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{103}.

To convert this to base-11, we divide 17 by 11, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 6. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A6.

In base-11, 4 + 6 = 10, which we write as "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 8 + 4 + 1. In base-11, 8 + 4 = 12, and 12 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 11, we need to carry over again. We write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column, which is the hundreds place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add in the hundreds place, we simply write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 13A. Therefore, 84 + 46 in base-11 is \\boxed{13A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, this is equivalent to 11, which we write as 10. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 6 + 1. In base-11, this is equivalent to 14, which we write as 13.\n\nSo, the final result is 130 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{130}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's convert the numbers A4 and 20 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, A4 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (4 * 11^0) = 110 + 4 = 114 in base-10.\n\n20 in base-11 is equal to (2 * 11^1) + (0 * 11^0) = 22 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 114 + 22 = 136.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 136 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 136 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 4.\n2. Divide the quotient (12) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 12 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 1.\n3.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  35\n+A9\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 5 + 9. In base-11, this would be 14, which we can write as 3 with a carry-over of 1 (since 14 - 11 = 3). So, we write down a 3 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  35\n+A9\n---\n  3\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 3 + A (which is 10 in base-10) + the carry-over of 1. This gives us 3 + 10 + 1 = 14 in base-10. In base-11, this is equal to 13 (since 14 - 11 = 3), so we write down a 3 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  35\n+A9\n---\n 33\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we can now write down the carry-over:\n\n```\n  35\n+A9\n---\n133\n```\n\nSo, 35 + A9 in base-11 is \\boxed{133}.

To do this, we'll divide 164 by 11 and find the remainder.\n\n164 \xf7 11 = 14 with a remainder of 10.

First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier. \n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10.

To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 127 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 127 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 6. So, the first digit (from the right) in base-11 is 6.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (11) by 11 again: 11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0. So, the second digit (from the right) in base-11 is 0.\n\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, we have reached the final digit in base-11, which is 1.\n\nSo, the result of A3 + 13 in base-11 is 106 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{106}.

So, we have:\n\n  53\n+99\n-----\n  1\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place, including the carry-over: 5 + 9 + 1. In base-11, this would be:\n\n5 + 9 + 1 = 15\n\nSince 15 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column (hundreds place) and write down the remainder, which is 4.

To do this, we'll divide 132 by 11 and find the remainders.\n\n132 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 0. So, the 11^0 place value is 0.\n\nNow, we'll divide 12 by 11 to find the 11^1 place value.\n\n12 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 1. So, the 11^1 place value is 1.\n\nFinally, we'll divide 1 by 11 to find the 11^2 place value.\n\n1 \xf7 11 = 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the 11^2 place value is 1.\n\nPutting these place values together, we get the base-11 number 110.\n\nSo, 14 + A7 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{110}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the ones place: 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place: 8 + 7 = 15. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14 (1 in the tens place and 4 in the ones place).\n\nSo, we carry over the 1 and add it to the tens place: 1 + 8 + 7 = 10.

Since A in base-11 represents the value 10 in base-10, we have 9 + 10 = 19. In base-11, 19 is represented as 1A, so we have a 1 in the tens place and an A in the ones place.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the tens place: 8 + 1 (from the previous step) = 9.\n\nSo, the final result is 9A + 8A = \\boxed{91A}.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to convert 16 to base-11. \n\n16 in base-10 is equal to 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0, so in base-11, 16 is represented as 15. \n\nNow, we can combine the results from both columns: 15 (from the 11's place) and 4 (from the 1's place). This gives us the final result of 154 in base-11.\n\nSo, 71 + 93 in base-11 is \\boxed{154}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's break down the numbers 65 and 5A into their place values in base-11.\n\n65 in base-11 means (6 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0) = 66 + 5 = 71 in base-10.\n\n5A in base-11 means (5 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = 55 + 10 = 65 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these base-10 numbers: 71 + 65 = 136.\n\nNow, we need to convert 136 back to base-11. \n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 136 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 136 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 4. This means that there are 12 groups of 11 in 136, with 4 left over.\n\n2.

Since the new quotient (1) is less than 11, we can write it down as the leftmost digit of the base-11 number.\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of 136 is 114.\n\nTherefore, 65 + 5A in base-11 is \\boxed{114}.

The number AA represents 10*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 110 + 10 = 120 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers: 38 + 120 = 158.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 158 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 158 \xf7 11 = 14 with a remainder of 4. This means that there are 14 groups of 11 in 158, with 4 left over.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (14) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 14 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 3. This means that there is 1 group of 11^2 (121) in 14, with 3 groups of 11 left over.\n\n3. The final quotient (1) is less than 11, so we don't need to divide any further.\n\nNow, we can write the result in base-11 using the remainders and final quotient: 1*11^2 + 3*11^1 + 4*11^0 = 134 in base-11.\n\nSo, 35 + AA in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{134}.

Since we are in base-11, we know that 10 is represented by the digit "A". So, 6 + 9 = 15 in base-10, which is equal to 1A in base-11 (1 * 11^1 + A * 11^0).\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (the 11's place): A + 8 + 1 (the 1 comes from the carry-over from the previous step). In base-10, A is equal to 10, so we have 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 in base-10. To convert this back to base-11, we have 1 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0, which is equal to 18 in base-11.\n\nFinally, we combine the results from both columns: 18 in the 11's place and 1A in the 1's place.

In base-11, 6 + 9 = 15, which is represented as "E" (since E is the 15th digit in base-11). So, we write down "E" and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 6 + 1 = 14. In base-11, 14 is represented as "13" (since 1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0 = 14). \n\nSo, the final result is 13E. Therefore, the sum of 76 and 69 in base-11 is \\boxed{13E}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): A (which is 10 in base-10) and 3. \n\nIn base-10, A + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13. Since we are working in base-11, 13 in base-10 is equal to 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0, which is 12 in base-11.

Since we are working in base-11, 16 in base-10 is equal to 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0, which is 15 in base-11. \n\nSo, the final result is 152 in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 7A + 83 in base-11 is \\boxed{152}.

In base-10, this would be 11, but in base-11, it is represented as "10". So, we write down "1" and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we can write down the carry-over "1" in the next place (the 121s place).\n\nSo, the final result is 1A1 in base-11.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ A7\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have A + 7. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 7 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  6A\n+ A7\n-----\n   7\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 1 (carried over) + 6 + A. Remember that A represents 10, so we have 1 + 6 + 10 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  6A\n+ A7\n-----\n  77\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we can stop here. The result of 6A + A7 in base-11 is \\boxed{177}.

Since A in base-11 represents the value 10 in base-10, we have 5 + 10 = 15 in base-10. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14, so we write down a 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (the 11's place): 9 + 1 + the carried-over 1. In base-10, this is 9 + 1 + 1 = 11. In base-11, 11 is represented as 10, so we write down a 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next column (the 121's place). Since there are no other numbers in this column, the result is simply 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the base-11 number: 114. So, the sum of 95 and 1A in base-11 is \\boxed{114}.

First, let's add the digits in the ones place: 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the tens place: 6 + 7 = 13. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we carry over the 1 to the next place.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over digit to the result: 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the tens place and 3 in the ones place, so the result is \\boxed{13A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1's place): 8 + 2. In base-11, this is straightforward: 8 + 2 = 10. Since 10 is represented by the letter "A" in base-11, we write down "A" and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11's place): 7 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-11, this is also straightforward: 7 + 5 + 1 = 13. However, 13 is greater than the highest digit in base-11 (which is "A" or 10), so we need to carry over again. To do this, we subtract 11 from 13, which gives us 2. We write down "2" and carry over a 1 to the next column (the 121's place).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over "1" in the 121's place.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the 121's place, 2 in the 11's place, and A in the 1's place, which gives us the base-11 number: \\boxed{12A}.

First, let's break down the numbers 50 and 51 in base-11.\n\n50 in base-11 means (5 * 11^1) + (0 * 11^0) = 55 in base-10.\n51 in base-11 means (5 * 11^1) + (1 * 11^0) = 56 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 55 + 56 = 111.\n\nNow, we need to convert 111 back to base-11. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 111 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   111 \xf7 11 = 10 with a remainder of 1.\n\n2. The remainder (1) is the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in the base-11 representation.\n\n3. Divide the quotient (10) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder.\n   10 \xf7 11 = 0 with a remainder of 10.\n\n4. The remainder (10) is the next least significant digit in the base-11 representation. Since 10 is represented by "A" in base-11, we use "A" as the digit.\n\n5. Since the quotient is now 0, we have found all the digits in the base-11 representation.\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of 111 in base-10 is "A1".\n\nTherefore, 50 + 51 in base-11 is \\boxed{A1}.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  6A\n+70\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have A + 0. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, A + 0 = 10.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column. We have 6 + 7, which is 13 in base-10. However, we need to represent this in base-11. To do this, we can divide 13 by 11 and find the remainder. \n\n13 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 2. So, in base-11, 13 is represented as 12.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the result:\n\n```\n  6A\n+70\n-----\n 12A\n```\n\nSo, 6A + 70 in base-11 is \\boxed{12A}.

To do this, we'll divide by the highest power of 11 that is less than the result and find the remainder:\n\n210 \xf7 11^2 = 210 \xf7 121 = 1 remainder 89 (since 121 > 210, we know the quotient is 0 and the remainder is 210)\n\nNow, we'll divide the remainder by the next lower power of 11:\n\n89 \xf7 11^1 = 89 \xf7 11 = 8 remainder 1\n\nFinally, we'll divide the remainder by 11^0:\n\n1 \xf7 11^0 = 1 \xf7 1 = 1\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 181.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers A0 and 52 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 represents the number 10 in base-10. So, A0 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (0 * 11^0) = 110 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 52 in base-11 to base-10.

To add A5 and 54 in base-11, we'll start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 4.\n\n5 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the rightmost digit of the sum is 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost digits, which are A and 5. In base-11, A represents the value 10.\n\n10 + 5 = 15\n\nSince 15 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over the extra value. To do this, we'll subtract the base from the sum and carry over the remaining value.\n\n15 - 11 = 4\n\nSo, we carry over the value 4 to the next position (which is the thousands place in this case).\n\nNow, we have:\n\n  4\nA5\n54\n--\n\nAdding the carried-over value to the leftmost digits, we get:\n\n4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, the leftmost digit of the sum is 4.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the sum A5 + 54 = 49 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{49}.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  56\n+A8\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 6 + 8.

So, we write down the 3 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  56\n+A8\n----\n  3\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 5 + A + 1 (the carry-over). In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 5 + 10 + 1 = 16. In base-11, this would be represented as "15". So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  56\n+A8\n----\n 53\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we can stop here. The result of 56 + A8 in base-11 is \\boxed{153}.

To do this, we'll divide by the highest power of 11 that is less than the result and find the remainder:\n\n181 \xf7 11^1 = 181 \xf7 11 = 16 R5\n\nSo, we have 16 in the 11^1 place and 5 in the 11^0 place. Now, we need to represent 16 in base-11:\n\n16 \xf7 11^1 = 16 \xf7 11 = 1 R5\n\nSo, we have 1 in the 11^2 place and 5 in the 11^1 place. Putting it all together, we get:\n\n1 * 11^2 + 5 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0 = 1A5 (in base-11)\n\nTherefore, 86 + 7A in base-11 is \\boxed{1A5}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-10, this would be 11, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place (which would be the 121's place). So, we write down a 0 in the 11's place and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result.

We can fit 11 into 163 fourteen (14) times, so the coefficient for the 11^1 place is 14. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to represent 14 as 13 + 1, which is "A" in base-11. So, the coefficient for the 11^1 place is A.\n\nNow, we subtract (A * 11^1) from 163: 163 - (13 * 11) = 163 - 143 = 20.\n\nThe largest power of 11 less than or equal to 20 is 11^0 = 1. We can fit 1 into 20 twenty (20) times, so the coefficient for the 11^0 place is 20. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to represent 20 as 18 + 2, which is "19" in base-11.

In base-11, this is equal to 12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place (the 121s place).

First, let's convert the numbers A4 and 22 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, A4 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (4 * 11^0) = 110 + 4 = 114 in base-10.\n\n22 in base-11 is equal to (2 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 22 + 2 = 24 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 114 + 24 = 138.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 138 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 138 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 6.\n2.

Since we are working in base-11, we need to represent 13 as a base-11 number. To do this, we divide 13 by 11 and find that it is equal to 1 remainder 2. So, we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the result and carry-over 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 as the leftmost digit of the result.\n\nSo, the final result is 129 in base-11.

Divide 178 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 178 \xf7 11 = 16 with a remainder of 2. So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in base-11 is 2.\n\n2.

So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place, along with the carry-over: 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. In base-11, 11 is represented as "10". So, we write down the 1 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the next place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the hundreds place, 1 in the tens place, and 2 in the ones place, which gives us the base-11 number:\n\n\\boxed{112}.

In base-11, this is straightforward since 6 + 2 = 8. So, we write down an 8 in the 1's place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (the 11's place): 7 + 5. In base-11, 7 + 5 = 12. However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 (which represents 11 in base-11) to the next column (the 121's place) and write down the remaining 2 in the 11's place of the result.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the 121's place, 2 in the 11's place, and 8 in the 1's place, which gives us the number 128 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, 76 + 52 in base-11 is \\boxed{128}.

First, let's convert the numbers A9 and 35 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, A9 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (9 * 11^0) = 110 + 9 = 119 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 35 from base-11 to base-10.

To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 157 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 157 \xf7 11 = 14 with a remainder of 3. This means that there is a 3 in the 11^0 place.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (14) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 14 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 3. This means that there is a 3 in the 11^1 place.\n\n3. The new quotient (1) is less than 11, so it becomes the digit in the 11^2 place.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 133.\n\nTherefore, A9 + 35 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{133}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1's place): 1 + 5. Since we are in base-11, this addition is the same as in base-10, so 1 + 5 = 6.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 11's place): 3 + 9. In base-10, this would be 3 + 9 = 12. However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 12 in base-11. To do this, we divide 12 by 11 and find that it is equal to 1 remainder 1. So, in base-11, 12 is represented as 11 + 1, or "1A".\n\nNow, we combine the results from the two columns: 1A (from the 11's place) and 6 (from the 1's place).

First, let's convert the numbers A3 and 28 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 represents the number 10 in base-10. So, A3 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (3 * 11^0) = 110 + 3 = 113 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 28 from base-11 to base-10. This is equal to (2 * 11^1) + (8 * 11^0) = 22 + 8 = 30 in base-10.\n\nNow, we can add the two numbers in base-10: 113 + 30 = 143.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 143 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 143 \xf7 11 = 13 with a remainder of 0. So, the last digit of the result in base-11 is 0.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (13) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 13 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 2. So, the second last digit of the result in base-11 is 2.\n\n3. The new quotient (1) is less than 11, so it becomes the first digit of the result in base-11.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result in base-11 as 120.\n\nSo, A3 + 28 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{120} in base-11.

Divide 128 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 128 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 7. So, the first digit (from the right) in base-11 is 7.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (11) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0. So, the second digit (from the right) in base-11 is 0.\n\n3. Since the new quotient (1) is less than 11, it becomes the next digit (from the right) in base-11.

Since 1 + 0 = 1, the rightmost digit of the sum is 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit. We have A and 4. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, we need to add 10 and 4, which equals 14. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to convert 14 to base-11 representation. \n\nTo do this, we divide 14 by 11, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 3. So, 14 in base-11 is represented as 13. Therefore, the next digit of the sum is 3, and we carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the remaining digits, which are both 0.

First, let's break down the numbers 1A and 94 in base-11.\n\n1A in base-11 means (1 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = 11 + 10 = 21 in base-10.\n\n94 in base-11 means (9 * 11^1) + (4 * 11^0) = 99 + 4 = 103 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 21 + 103 = 124.\n\nNow, we need to convert 124 back to base-11. \n\nTo do this, we can divide 124 by 11 and find the remainder:\n\n124 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 3.\n\nNow, we divide the quotient (11) by 11 again:\n\n11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of 124 is 103.\n\nTherefore, 1A + 94 in base-11 is \\boxed{103}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 4A+63? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 4A and 63 in base-11.\n\n4A in base-11 means (4 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = 44 + 10 = 54 in base-10.\n\n63 in base-11 means (6 * 11^1) + (3 * 11^0) = 66 + 3 = 69 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 54 + 69 = 123.\n\nNow, we need to convert 123 back to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we can divide 123 by 11 and find the remainder:\n\n123 \xf7 11 = 11 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we divide the quotient (11) by 11 again:\n\n11 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSince our quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, we can stop dividing and write down our base-11 number using the remainders and the last quotient:\n\nThe base-11 number is 102.\n\nSo, 4A + 63 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{102} in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A1+4A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers A1 and 4A from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA1 in base-11 means (10 * 1) + 1 = 11 in base-10.\n\n4A in base-11 means (4 * 11) + 10 = 44 + 10 = 54 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 11 + 54 = 65.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we divide 65 by 11 and find the remainder:\n\n65 \xf7 11 = 5 with a remainder of 10.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 5A.\n\nTherefore, A1 + 4A in base-11 is \\boxed{5A}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 75+50? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the given numbers from base-11 to base-10.\n\n75 in base-11 is equal to (7 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0) = 77 in base-10.\n\n50 in base-11 is equal to (5 * 11^1) + (0 * 11^0) = 55 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the base-10 numbers: 77 + 55 = 132.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 132 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 132 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 0. So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 0.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (12) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 12 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 1. So, the next digit (to the left) is 1.\n\n3. Since the new quotient (1) is less than 11, it becomes the most significant digit (leftmost digit).\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 110.\n\nTherefore, 75 + 50 in base-11 is \\boxed{110}.
