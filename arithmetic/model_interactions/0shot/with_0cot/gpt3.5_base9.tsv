You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 76+14? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 76 and 14 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=12, we write down the 2 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the 1s digits, which are 7 and 1, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So we have 7+1+1=9. Since 9 is the largest digit in base-9, we need to carry-over again. We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the 10s digits, which are 0 and 1, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So we have 0+1+1=2. \n\nTherefore, 76+14=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 86 and 57 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 7. In base-9, 6+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nSo, we write down the digit for 2 in the units place, and carry over the digit for 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 5, and add the carried over digit of 1. In base-9, 8+5+1=14, but again, there is no digit for 14 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nSo, we write down the digit for 5 in the tens place, and carry over the digit for 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carried over digit of 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 86+57=143 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{143}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 63 and 34 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. In base-9, 3+4=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. There are no 9s in 63 or 34, so we simply carry over the 0 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place, which represents 9^2s (or 81s). Again, there are no 81s in 63 or 34, so we carry over the 0 to the next digit. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  63\n+34\n---\n  101\n\nTherefore, 63+34 in base-9 is \\boxed{101}.

To add 31 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. Since 1+8=9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 5, and add the carried-over 1. We get 3+5+1=9, so we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carried-over 1. We get 1, so we write down the digit 1 in the third column. \n\nTherefore, 31+58=100 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{100}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 7+5=12, we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 2, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 9, which we write down as the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 1, which we write down as the digit 1. \n\nTherefore, 67+25 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{103}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 5+8=13, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 4 (the digits in the nines place). We also add the carry-over digit from the previous column, which is 1. So we have 7+4+1=12. We write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 0 and 1 (the carry-over digit from the previous column).

To add 87 and 50 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 0. This gives us 7. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. Here, we have 8 and 5. Adding these gives us 13, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the remainder, which is 4, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit). This gives us 1. Therefore, 87+50 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{141}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 85 and 45 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 5. In base-9, 5+5=11, but since we can only use digits 0-8, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 4, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 8+4+1=13, but again we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 85+45=131 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{131}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 38 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 8 (the tens digits). We also add the carry-over digit from the previous column, which is 1. So we have 3+8+1=12. Since 12 is greater than 9, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. So we have 1+0+0=1. \n\nTherefore, 38+81 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{103}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 25 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. Since 5+1=6 in base-9, we write down the digit 6 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 8, and add the carried-over 1. We get 2+8+1=11 in base-9. Since 11 is greater than 9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next column. The digit 11 in base-9 is represented by "12", so we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carried-over digit 1. We get 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 25+81=106 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{106}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 58 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n8+1 = 9, which becomes 0 in the units place and we carry over a 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 5 (the digit 8 was carried over from the previous step). 5+5=10, so we carry over a digit again:\n\n5+5+1 = 11, which becomes 2 in the tens place and we carry over a 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 1 (the digit 1 was carried over from the previous step). 1+1+1=3. So the final result is:\n\n58+51 = 110_{9}\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{110_{9}}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 8. Since 8+8=16, which is greater than 9, we need to carry over to the next place value. We represent 16 as 16-9=7 in base-9, so we write down 7 in the units place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 6 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 6+4+1=11, which is also greater than 9, so we need to carry over again. We represent 11 as 11-9=2 in base-9, so we write down 2 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the final carry-over of 1 in the hundreds place. Therefore, \n\n68+48=116 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{116}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 57 and 26 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n7+6 = 14 (carry-over 1)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 2, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get:\n\n5+2+1 = 8\n\nTherefore, 57+26 in base-9 is equal to 88, or \\boxed{88}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 63+52? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 63 and 52 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 2. In base-9, 3+2=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. In 63, the tens digit is 6, which is equivalent to 6*9=54 in base-10. In 52, the tens digit is 5, which is equivalent to 5*9=45 in base-10. To add these two numbers, we add 54 and 45 to get 99 in base-10. \n\nNow we need to convert 99 from base-10 to base-9. We can do this by dividing 99 by 9 and writing down the remainder, which is the units digit in base-9. The quotient is then divided by 9 again, and the remainder is the next digit in base-9, and so on, until the quotient is 0. \n\nIn this case, 99 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 0, so the units digit in base-9 is 0. The quotient is 11, which we divide by 9 to get 1 with a remainder of 2, so the next digit in base-9 is 2. Therefore, 99 in base-10 is equivalent to 120 in base-9. \n\nFinally, we write down the units digit 5 and the tens digit 2, giving us the sum 1205 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{1205}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 81+22? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 81 and 22 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 2. Since 1+2=3, we write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. In 81, there are no 9's, so we can just add the 2 from 22 to the 8 from 81, giving us 10. However, in base-9, we don't have a digit for 10, so we need to "carry over" to the next digit. We can think of this as adding 1 to the next digit to the left. So, we write down a 0 in the 9's place of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit.\n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, which is the 81's digit, we add the carried-over 1 to the 1 in 81, giving us 2. So, we write down 2 in the 81's place of the sum.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  81\n+22\n---\n103\n\nSo, in base-9, 81+22=103. \n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{103}$.

To add 78 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 8. \n\n8 + 8 = 16, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. 16 in base-9 is equivalent to 17 in base-10, which means we carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we have 7 + 5 + 1 (the carried over digit) = 13. But again, we need to carry over the extra digit. 13 in base-9 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, which means we carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we have 1 + 7 = 8. \n\nTherefore, 78 + 58 = 136 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{136}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 87 and 61 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 1. This gives us 8, which we can write as "10" in base-9 (since we are using digits 0-8). We carry the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9's column, which are 8 and 6 (since we carried the 1 from the units column). This gives us 14, which we can write as "16" in base-9. We carry the 1 to the next column again.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's column, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried the 1 from the 9's column).

In base-9, 1+5=6, which we can write as "6" in the units place of our answer. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the 9's place. There is a 6 in the 9's place of 61, and an 8 in the 9's place of 85. In base-9, 6+8=14, which is greater than 9. So we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value. We can write the 4 in the 9's place of our answer, and carry over the 1 to the 81's place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place. There is a 1 in the 81's place of 61, and no digits in the 81's place of 85.

To add 26 and 25 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 11 in base-9 as 12 (since 11=1*9+2). Therefore, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 2 (the carried-over digit plus the digit in the tens place).

Since 1+3=4, we write down the digit 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents the 9's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 3 and 8, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). 3+8=11, but since we are in base-9, we need to "carry-over" the extra digit. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 11, which gives us 2. So we write down the digit 2 as the 9's digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 31+83=114 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{114}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+2=7, so we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. We add the digits in this place, which are 5 and 7, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 5+7=12, which is greater than 8, so we need to carry-over to the next place. \n\nTo do this, we subtract 9 from 12, which gives us 3. We write down 3 as the digit in the nines place of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place to the carried-over 1. The digits in this place are 0 and 0, so we simply add 1 to get 1. We write down 1 as the digit in the 81s place of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 55+72=130 in base-9, which we can write as $\\boxed{130}$.

To add 18 and 80 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  18\n+ 80\n----\n```\n\nThe ones place (rightmost digit) gives us 8+0=8, which we can write as "8" in base-9. The nines place (second digit from the right) gives us 1+8=9, which is one full group of nine. In base-9, we represent this as "10" (one group of nine and zero ones). So we write the 9 in the nines place and carry the 1 to the next place:\n\n```\n  18\n+ 80\n----\n  10\n```\n\nThe next place (nines squared, or 81s place) has a carry of 1 from the previous step, plus 0 and 8 from the original numbers. This gives us 1+0+8=9, which is one full group of nine. So we write "10" in this place and carry the 1 to the next place:\n\n```\n  18\n+ 80\n----\n 110\n```\n\nFinally, the next place (nines cubed, or 729s place) has a carry of 1 from the previous step, plus 1 from the original 18. This gives us 1+1=2, which we can write as "2" in base-9. So the final result is:\n\n```\n  18\n+ 80\n----\n 110\n\\boxed{802}\n```	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 26+44? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 26 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=10 in base-9, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n6+4=10 (in base-9)\n10-9=1 (carry-over)\n1+2+4=7 (in base-9)\n\nTherefore, 26+44=70 in base-9, which we write as $\\boxed{70}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 67 and 33 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 3. Since 7+3=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, this means that we add 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  67\n+ 33\n----\n 100\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 3 (plus the 1 we carried over). This gives us:\n\n```\n  67\n+ 33\n----\n 100\n  1\n```\n\nTherefore, 67+33 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{101}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+7+1=13. However, since we are in base-9, we can only use digits from 0 to 8. Therefore, we need to "regroup" 13 as 1 ten and 4 ones.

This gives us 5+7+1=13 in base-9. Since 13 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the digit 5. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the last column, which are 0 and 1, and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1.

So we write down "2" as the digit in the 81's place of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we can write down the final result: \n\n61+60 = \\boxed{A21} in base-9.

To add 55 and 78 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 8. In base-9, 5+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 9's digits, which are 5 and 7. In base-9, 5+7=12, and we add the carry-over of 1 to get 13. However, there is no digit for 13 in base-9, so we need to carry over again to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 81's digits, which are 0 and 1. In base-9, 0+1=1, and we add the carry-over of 1 to get 2. \n\nTherefore, 55+78=133 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{133}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 34 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 7. In base-9, 4+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 2, and add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 3+2+1=6, so we write down 6 in the next place value.\n\nTherefore, the result of 34+27 in base-9 is \\boxed{61}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 40 and 52 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 2. Since 0+2=2, we write down 2 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 5. Since 4+5=8, we write down 8 as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 40+52 in base-9 is equal to 82. \n\n\\boxed{82}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 24 and 75 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 5. Since 4+5=9, we carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 2 and 7, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 2+7+1=10, which is equal to 1*9+1. Therefore, we write down the digit 1 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, the result of 24+75 in base-9 is \\boxed{100}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 87 and 65 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 5. In base-9, 7+5=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 6, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step. In base-9, 8+6+1=15, but again, there is no digit for 15 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 6 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the result of 87+65 in base-9 is \\boxed{161}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 27 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are both 7. This gives us a total of 14, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 4 units in base-9. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are both 2. We also add the carried-over 1 from the previous step.

To add 70 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 5. This gives us 5 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 13 in base-9. However, we can't write 13 in base-9 because the highest digit is 8. Instead, we write 13 as 1 ten and 3 ones. So we write down the digit 3 in the tens place and carry-over the digit 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 1 and 0, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 70+55 in base-9 is \\boxed{23}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 32 and 71 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 1. In base-9, 2+1=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In 32, there are no nines, so we can just copy the digit from 71. The nines digit of the sum is 7. \n\nTherefore, 32+71 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{73}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 78 and 57 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 7. \n\n8 + 7 = 15 \n\nSince 15 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next place value. We divide 15 by 9 and get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6. We write down the remainder (6) in the units place and carry over the quotient (1) to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5, and add the carry-over from the previous step: \n\n7 + 5 + 1 = 13 \n\nAgain, 13 is greater than 8, so we divide by 9 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 4. We write down the remainder (4) in the tens place and carry over the quotient (1) to the hundreds place. \n\nSince there are no digits in the hundreds place for either number, we can simply write down the carry-over quotient of 1 in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, \n\n78 + 57 = 136 \n\nIn base-9, the result is \\boxed{136}.

To add 83 and 71 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 9's digits, which are 8 and 7, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 8+7=16, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. We write down the units digit of 16, which is 7, and we carry-over the digit 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next digit to the left, which is the 81's digit. In this case, there is no carry-over, so we simply add the 8 and 7. In base-9, 8+7=15, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. We write down the units digit of 15, which is 6, and we carry-over the digit 1 to the next step. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over digit as the leftmost digit of the sum. Therefore, \n\n83+71=154 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{154}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 63+52? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 63 and 52 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 2. In base-9, 3+2=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. In 63, the tens digit is 6, which is equivalent to 6*9=54 in base-10. In 52, the tens digit is 5, which is equivalent to 5*9=45 in base-10. To add these two numbers, we add 54 and 45 to get 99 in base-10. \n\nNow we need to convert 99 from base-10 to base-9. We can do this by dividing 99 by 9 and writing down the remainder, which is the units digit in base-9. The quotient is then divided by 9 again, and the remainder is the next digit in base-9, and so on, until the quotient is 0. \n\nIn this case, 99 divided by 9 is 11 with a remainder of 0, so the units digit in base-9 is 0. The quotient is 11, which we divide by 9 to get 1 with a remainder of 2, so the next digit in base-9 is 2. Therefore, 99 in base-10 is equivalent to 120 in base-9. \n\nFinally, we write down the units digit 5 and the tens digit 2, giving us the sum 1205 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{1205}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 4, which we can write as 4 in base-9.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 6. This gives us 13, which is equivalent to 14 in base-9 (since we are using digits 0-8). We write down the 4 in the units place and carry the 1 over to the hundreds place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 1 (from the carry) and 0. This gives us 1, which we write down in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, 73+61 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{141}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 20 and 83 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3, with no carrying. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 2 and 8. This gives us 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 1 unit. We write down the unit digit (which is 1) and carry the ten to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 (since we carried the 2) and 8. We also add the carried ten, giving us 18 in base-9, which is equivalent to 2 nines and 0 units. We write down the unit digit (which is 0) and carry the two nines to the next column. \n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we have our final result: \n\n\\boxed{101}.

In base-9, 2+7+1=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 1 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0 (the carried-over digit from the tens place). In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  27\n+ 74\n----\n 101\n\nTherefore, 27+74=101 in base-9, and the final answer is $\\boxed{101}$.

To add 68 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n8 + 1 = 9\n9 - 9 = 0 (write 0 in the units place)\n1 + 1 = 2 (add the carry-over to the next place value)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 3, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n11 - 9 = 2 (write 2 in the tens place)\n1 + 0 = 1 (add the carry-over to the hundreds place)\n\nTherefore, 68+31 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{201}$.

To add 82 and 76 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 6. In base-9, 2+6=8, which we can write as "8" in the units place of our answer. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the 9's place. In 82, there are 8 nines, and in 76, there are 7 nines. So we have 8+7=15 nines in total. However, 15 is not a digit in base-9, so we need to "carry over" one of the nines to the next place value. This leaves us with 6 nines in the 9's place and 1 nine carried over to the 81's place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place. In 82, there is 1 eight in the 81's place, and in 76, there is 1 seven in the 81's place (since we carried over a nine from the 9's place).

However, in base-9, we can only use digits 0 through 8, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In other words, we add 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n  65\n+ 60\n----\n  15\n```\n\nFinally, we add 1 and 1, which gives us 2:\n\n```\n  65\n+ 60\n----\n 125\n```\n\nTherefore, 65+60 in base-9 is $\\boxed{125}$.

We get 6+7+1=14, which is also greater than 9, so we need to carry over again. We represent 14 as 14-9=5 in base-9, so we write down 5 as the tens digit and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 44 and 77 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 4 and 7. In base-9, 4+7=11, but since we only have digits up to 8, we need to carry over to the next digit. So we write down 3 (which is 11 in base-9) and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are both 4. But we also need to add the 1 that we carried over from the previous step. So we have 4+4+1=10, which is written as 11 in base-9. Again, we write down 3 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0. But we also need to add the 1 that we carried over from the previous step. So we have 0+0+1=1, which is written as 1 in base-9. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 34 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 5. Since 4+5=8, we write down 8 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 5. Since 3+5=8, we write down 8 as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 34+55=88 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{88}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 27 and 54 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 4. Since 7+4=11, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 2 and 5, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 8. \n\nTherefore, 27+54=81 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 70 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 6+0=6 in the ones place. In base-9, 6 is simply represented as "6", so we write that down:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n   6\n```\n\nMoving to the next digit, we have 7+7=14 in the nines place. However, in base-9 we only have digits up to 8, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In other words, we subtract 9 from 14 to get 5, and carry over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n   6\n  15\n```\n\nFinally, in the third digit from the right, we have 1+0=1 in the nines-squared place. So we write that down:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n   6\n  15\n   1\n```\n\nTherefore, the result of 76+70 in base-9 is $\\boxed{161}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 72 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 1. In base-9, 2+1=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents 9s. In 72, the digit in the 9s place is 7, and in 81, the digit in the 9s place is 8. Adding these two digits gives us 15 in base-9. However, 15 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry over" to the next digit to the left. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over from 15 means adding 1 to the next digit to the left. So we write down 6 (the remainder of 15 when divided by 9) as the digit in the 9s place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place of 72 and 81, which are both 0. We also add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. This gives us 1 in base-9, which we write down as the digit in the 81s place of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  72\n+ 81\n----\n 153\n\nTherefore, 72+81=153 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{153}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 8+8=16, we have to carry-over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 86+80=166 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{166}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 63 and 77 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 7. Since 3+7=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, this means that we add 1 to the next digit. However, there is no next digit in this case, so we write down a 1 in the next place value and carry over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 7, and add the carried over 1. This gives us 14 in base-9. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we write down a 5 in the next place value and carry over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 1 and 0, and add the carried over 1. This gives us 2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 63+77=152 in base-9, or \\boxed{152}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 5 is less than 9, we write down 5 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  20\n+ 85\n----\n   5\n```\n\nIn the nines place, we have 2 + 8 = 10.

To add 85 and 20 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 0. This gives us 5. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. We add 8, 2, and the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0), giving us 10. However, since we are in base-9, we need to regroup this as 1 nine and 1 left over. So we write down the left over digit, which is 1, and carry-over the 1 nine to the next digit. Finally, we add the left over digit to the next digit from the right, which is the 81's digit.

To add 72 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 4. In base-9, 2+4=6, which we write as "6" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 7 and 7. In base-9, 7+7=14, but we can't write "14" in the tens place because that is a two-digit number. Instead, we write "14" as "41" in base-9, with the "1" in the tens place and the "4" carried over to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{141}\n\nSo, 72+74 in base-9 is equal to 141.

To add 61 and 47 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 7. In base-9, 1+7=8, which we can write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 6 and 4. In base-9, 6+4=12, but we can't write "12" in base-9 because there is no digit for "12". Instead, we write "12" as "13" (since 1*9 + 3*1 = 12). So we write "3" in the tens place and carry-over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (from 61) and 1 (from carrying-over the 1 from the tens place). In base-9, 0+1=1, so we write "1" in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  61\n+ 47\n----\n 108\n\nSo 61+47 in base-9 is \\boxed{108}.

To add 68 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 6. Since 8+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n8+6 = 14\n14-9 = 5 (write down 5 in the units place)\n1 (carry-over to the next place value)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 1 (the carry-over). 6+1=7, so we write down 7 in the tens place. Therefore:\n\n68+16 = 85\n\nThus, the result is $\\boxed{85}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 75 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 5. This gives us 5 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit since 5 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 7 (since we carried over from the units place). This gives us 14 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit since 14 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 1 (since we carried over from the tens place). This gives us 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 70+75 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{150}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 83 and 64 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. In base-9, 3+4=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents 9s. In 83, there are 8 nines, and in 64, there are 6 nines. So we have 8+6=14 nines in total. However, in base-9, we can only use digits 0-8, so we need to "carry over" one of the nines to the next digit. This leaves us with 5 nines in the tens place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n83\n+64\n---\n147\n\nTherefore, 83+64=147 in base-9, which we write as $\\boxed{147}$.

To add 81 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 8 and 3. In base-9, 8+3=12, which is greater than 9. So we write down the rightmost digit of 12, which is 3, and carry-over the leftmost digit, which is 1. \n\nAdding the carried-over digit to the next digit from the left, we have 1+1+3=5. So we write down 5 as the next digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 81+31=112 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{112}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Therefore, we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down "5" (the digit that represents 14-9) in the tens place, and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (the carried-over digit) and 0. In base-9, 0+0=0, so we write down "0" in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{150}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 33 and 85 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 5. In base-9, 3+5=8, which we can write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the nine's place. However, there are no nines in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. In this case, we carry over to the 9's place. \n\nIn the 9's place, we have 3+8 (the carried over 1 from the units place plus the digit in the 9's place of 33) and 8+5 (the digit in the 9's place of 85). \n\n3+8=11, but we can't write "11" in base-9 because there is no digit for 11. Instead, we write "2" in the 9's place and carry over the 1 to the 81's place. \n\n8+5=13, but we can't write "13" in base-9 because there is no digit for 13. Instead, we write "4" in the 81's place and carry over the 1 to the 729's place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 729's place, which is just the carried over 1 from the previous step. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  33\n+ 85\n----\n 118\n\nTherefore, 33+85 in base-9 is \\boxed{118}.

To add 35 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. Since 5+1=6 in base-9, we write down the digit 6 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 8, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 3+8+1=12 in base-9. Since 12 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over again. We write down the digit 4 (which is 12-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the last column, which is 1.

To add 83 and 50 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 50\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have:\n\n- 3 + 0 = 3\n- 8 + 5 = 13, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over from 8 to the next place value is equivalent to adding 1 and subtracting 9. So we write down 4 (the digit for 13-9) and carry over 1 to the next place value:\n```\n  83\n+ 50\n----\n   3\n  4\n```\n- 1 + 8 = 9, which is the largest digit in base-9.

To add 51 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. Since 1+8=9, which is one digit in base-9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 5 and 5 (the carried-over 1 plus the digit in the tens place). 5+5=10, which is two digits in base-9. We write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 0 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 0 (the carried-over digit) and 1. 0+1=1, which is one digit in base-9.

To add 36 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 1. Since 6+1=7, we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. In 36, the tens digit is 3, and in 81, the tens digit is 8. Adding these two digits gives us 11. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot write down 11 as a two-digit number. Instead, we need to "carry over" the extra digit to the next place value. Specifically, we can write down the digit 2 in the tens place of the sum, and carry over the digit 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 0 (since there is no hundreds digit in 36 and 81).

In base-9, 3+4=7, so we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the 8 and 7. In base-9, 8+7=16, but we can't write down 16 as a single digit in base-9. Instead, we write down the remainder when 16 is divided by 9, which is 7. We also have a carry-over of 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 83+74=160 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{160}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9 or 10, so we carry over to the next digit when we reach 8. Therefore, we write down 0 in the units place and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 2 and 5, and add the carry-over of 1. This gives us 8.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 47+88? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 47 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 15-9=6 as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 4 and 8 (the carried-over 1 is added to the 4). 4+8+1=13, which is greater than 8, so we carry over 1 again. We write down 13-9=4 as the second digit from the right of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0 (the carried-over 1 is added to the leftmost 0). 0+0+1=1, which is less than 9, so we write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nTherefore, 47+88=135 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{135}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 67 and 17 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 7. This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 ten and 4 units in base-9. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 6 and 1, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 8. \n\nTherefore, 67+17 in base-9 is equal to 84. \n\n\\boxed{84}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 52 and 80 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  52\n+ 80\n----\n```\n\nIn the ones place, 2 plus 0 is 2:\n\n```\n  52\n+ 80\n----\n   2\n```\n\nIn the nines place, 5 plus 8 is 13, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9). So we need to carry over to the next place value:\n\n```\n  52\n+ 80\n----\n   2\n  1\n```\n\nIn the 81s place, 1 plus 5 (the carried-over digit) plus 8 is 14, which is also greater than 8. So we need to carry over again:\n\n```\n  52\n+ 80\n----\n   2\n  11\n```\n\nFinally, in the 729s place, we have 1 plus 1 (the carried-over digit) is 2:\n\n```\n  52\n+ 80\n----\n   2\n  11\n   2\n```\n\nTherefore, 52+80 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{211_9}$.

To add 40 and 67 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to 9, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the current digit and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n0 + 7 = 7 \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 4 and 6, and add the carry-over of 1:\n\n4 + 6 + 1 = 11 \n\nAgain, since 11 is greater than or equal to 9, we need to carry over to the next digit:\n\n11 - 9 = 2 \n\nSo the final result is:\n\n40 + 67 = 107_{9} = \\boxed{119}.

To add 70 and 21 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 1. Since 0+1=1, we write down 1 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 7 and 2. Since 7+2=8, we write down 8 as the next digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 70+21 in base-9 is equal to 81. \n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 60 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 6 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit since 6 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 7 and 6 (the carried-over 1 from the units digit). This gives us 14 in base-9, but we again need to carry over to the next digit since 14 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nFinally, we have a carry-over of 1 to add to the hundreds digit, which is 1. This gives us a final result of 131 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 70+60 = \\boxed{131}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 4 and 5. In base-9, 4+5=8, so we write down 8 as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 42+53=85 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{85}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 26 and 85 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 11 as 12 in base-9. Therefore, the units digit of the sum is 2, and we carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nines column, which are 2 and 8 (since 26 and 85 have digits in the nines place). Adding these digits gives us 10 in base-10, which we regroup as 11 in base-9. We add the carry-over from the previous column to get 11+1=12 in base-9. Therefore, the nines digit of the sum is 3, and we carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s column, which are 0 and 1 (since 26 and 85 have no digits in the 81s place). Adding these digits gives us 1 in base-9. We add the carry-over from the previous column to get 1+1=2 in base-9. Therefore, the 81s digit of the sum is 2. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{113}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 72 and 66 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 6. In base-9, 2+6=8, which we write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. We have 7+6=13 in base-10, but in base-9 we can only use digits 0-8. So we need to "carry over" one base-9 unit to the next place value. This means we write down "4" in the tens place (since 7+6+1=14 in base-9, and 14-9=5, which we write as "4" in base-9). \n\nTherefore, 72+66=140 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{140}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 2+2=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 7 and 8. In base-9, 7+8=15, but we can't write down 15 as a single digit in base-9. Instead, we write down the remainder when 15 is divided by 9, which is 6. We also carry-over the quotient when 15 is divided by 9, which is 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the hundreds digit, which is 1+0=1. \n\nTherefore, 72+82=146 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{146}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 2+2=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 6 and 4. In base-9, 6+4=12, but since there is no digit for "12" in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, 12 is equivalent to 1 ten and 3 units, so we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum and carry over the 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (since we carried over the 1 from the tens place) and 0. In base-9, 0+0=0, so we write down 0 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  62\n+42\n---\n104\n\nTherefore, 62+42 in base-9 is \\boxed{104}.

To add 85 and 76 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 6. In base-9, 5+6=11, but since there is no digit for 11 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nSo, we write down the digit for 1 in the units place, and carry over the digit for 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 7, and add the carried over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 8+7+1=16, but again, there is no digit for 16 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nSo, we write down the digit for 7 in the tens place, and carry over the digit for 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carried over digit from the previous step, which is 1.

Since 6+3=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 8 and 4, plus the carried-over digit 1. This gives us 13 in base-9, which we write down as the tens digit 4 and carry-over the hundreds digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digit 1 to the carried-over digit 1, which gives us 2 in base-9.

To add 83 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. Since 3+6=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum. So we write down a 0 in the units place and add 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 8 and 1 (the digits in the nines place). We also add the 1 that we carried over from the units place. 8+1+1=10, so we carry over another digit to the next place value. Again, we write down a 0 in the current place value and add 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is just 1 (the digit in the 81s place). We also add the 1 that we carried over from the previous step. 1+1=2, so the final result is 20. \n\nTherefore, 83+16=20 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{20}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Adding them gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 nine and 3 units. We write down the 3 and carry over the 1 nine to the next digit. Finally, we add the carried over 1 nine to the next digit, which represents 81s. Here, we have 0 and 0, so we simply write down the carried over 1 nine.

In base-9, 5+5=11, but since we are using only one digit, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value. So we write down "2" in the tens place (representing 11 in base-9) and carry over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (from 51) and 1 (from carrying over).

We write down the remainder of 15 divided by 9 (which is 6) and carry over the quotient (which is 1) to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 7 and 1 (the carried-over digit). We get 8. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place from the right, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit).

However, since we are using only the digits 0-8, we need to "carry over" to the next digit. In base-10, we would carry over when the sum is 10 or greater. In base-9, we carry over when the sum is 9 or greater. \n\nSo, we write down the 1 in the units place and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place: 7 + 8 + 1 (the carried-over digit) = 16 in base-9. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we write down the 7 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place: 1 + 1 = 2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 77 + 84 = 201 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{201}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 6+4=12, but since there is no digit "9" in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. We can think of 12 as 1 group of 9 and 3 left over. So we write down the digit "3" in the tens place, and carry over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 0. In base-9, 1+0=1, which we write in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  63\n+ 44\n----\n 107\n\nTherefore, 63+44 in base-9 is \\boxed{107}.

To add 54 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 5. Since 4+5=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n4+5 = 9, carry over 1\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 1 and 4 (the digit we carried over plus the digit in the tens place). 1+4=5, so we have:\n\n1+4 = 5\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n54\n+74\n---\n128\n\nBut we can't leave our answer in base-9, so we need to simplify it. The largest digit in base-9 is 8, so we need to "carry over" whenever we have a digit that is 9 or larger. In this case, we have a 1 in the hundreds place and a 2 in the ones place, so we need to carry over twice. That gives us:\n\n128 in base-9 is equivalent to 151 in base-10.\n\nTherefore, 54+74 = \\boxed{151}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 85 and 40 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 0. Since 5+0=5, the units digit of the sum is 5. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 4. Since 8+4=12, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 85+40=125 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{125}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 87 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 0. Since 7+0=7, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 8. Since 8+8=16, we have to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n8+8 = 16\n16-9 = 7\nCarry over 1\n\nTherefore, the tens digit of the sum is 7 and we carry over 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 1 (the carried over digit). 0+1=1, so the hundreds digit of the sum is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  87\n+80\n---\n 167\n\nTherefore, 87+80 in base-9 is \\boxed{167}.

To add 77 and 87 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 7. This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 nine and 5 ones. We write down the 5 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 7 and 8, and we add the carried-over 1 from the previous column. This gives us 16, which is equal to 1 nine and 7 ones. We write down the 7 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there was a carry-over from the previous column) and 8, and we add the carried-over 1 from the previous column. This gives us 9, which is equal to 1 nine and 0 ones. We write down the 0 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carried-over 1 as the leftmost digit, giving us the final answer of $\\boxed{165}$.

To add 22 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. In 22, there is no tens digit, so we can treat it as having a 0 in that place. In 73, the tens digit is 7. We add this to the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0), giving us 7. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digit, which is also 0 in 22, and the thousands digit, which is also 0 in both numbers. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }_{\\boxed{1}}\\phantom{ }_{\\boxed{5}}\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }+_{\\phantom{1}}\\phantom{ }_{\\boxed{7}}\\phantom{ }_{\\phantom{1}}\\\\\n&\\underline{\\phantom{ }_{\\phantom{1}}\\phantom{ }_{\\phantom{1}}\\phantom{ }_{\\phantom{1}}}\\phantom{ }_{\\boxed{5}}\\phantom{ }_{\\boxed{1}}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 22+73=51 in base-9, which we write as $\\boxed{51}$.

To add 81 and 78 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. Since 1+8=9, we write down 0 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place, which are 8 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 8+1=9, so we write down 0 in the second place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place, which are 1 and 7 (the carried-over digit). 1+7=8, so we write down 8 in the third place. \n\nTherefore, 81+78=159 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{159}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 33 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3 in base-9. We then move on to the next digit, which is the 7 in 70 and the 3 in 33. Adding these gives us 10 in base-9, but since we can only use digits 0-8, we need to carry over to the next digit. So we write down a 1 in the next digit place and subtract 9 from the 10, which gives us 1. Finally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit, which is the 1 in 70. This gives us 2. Therefore, 70+33 in base-9 is \\boxed{23}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 3+4=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents 9s. In 83, there are 8 nines, and in 34, there are 3 nines. So we have 8+3=11 nines in total. However, in base-9, we can only use digits 0-8, so we need to "carry over" one of the nines to the next digit. This leaves us with 2 nines in the tens place and 1 nine carried over to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n83\n+34\n---\n  120\n\nSo 83+34 in base-9 is \\boxed{120}.

To add 58 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 4. Since 8+4=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 4, plus the carried-over digit 1. This gives us 10, which we write down as the tens digit and carry-over the hundreds digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, plus the carried-over digit 1.

However, 16 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we add 1 to the sum of the next digits, which are both 8 again. This gives us 17. \n\nAgain, 17 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we carry over to the next digit. We add 1 to the sum of the next digits, which are both 0. This gives us 1. \n\nSo the final answer is 101\\boxed{1}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 12, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next place value.\n\nWe carry over 1 to the 81's place (9 squared), and add the remaining 2 to the 8's place. This gives us 1 in the 81's place, 2 in the 8's place, and 4 in the units place.\n\nTherefore, 54+40 in base-9 is \\boxed{121}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Adding these gives us 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 1 unit. We write down the 1 in the 9's place and carry over the 1 ten to the next digit.

Instead, we write "2" in the tens place and carry-over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over "1" to the hundreds digits, which are both 0.

To add 53 and 41 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the 9's digit. In 53, there are 5 nines, and in 41, there are 4 nines. Together, they make 9 nines, which is one more than the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we need to "carry over" one nine to the next digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over one nine to the next digit is the same as adding 1 to the next digit. So we add 1 to the sum of the next digits, which are the 81's digits. In 53, there are 5 eighty-ones, and in 41, there are 4 eighty-ones. Together, they make 9 eighty-ones, plus the carried-over 1, which is 10 eighty-ones. \n\nHowever, 10 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over one eighty-one to the next digit. Again, this is the same as adding 1 to the next digit. In the next digit, which is the 729's digit, there are no nines to carry over, but we need to add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. In 53, there are 4 seven-hundred-twenty-nines, and in 41, there are 4 seven-hundred-twenty-nines. Together, they make 8 seven-hundred-twenty-nines, plus the carried-over 1, which is 9 seven-hundred-twenty-nines. \n\nFinally, we have added all the digits and obtained the sum of 94 in base-9.

However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over digit (which is 1) to the digits in that column, which are 5 and 4. This gives us a total of 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to 11 in base-10. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. \n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we add the carried-over digit (which is 1) to the digit in that column, which is 0. This gives us a total of 1 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 in base-10. \n\nTherefore, 55+45=101 in base-9, which is equivalent to \\boxed{110} in base-10.

When we add 8 and 3 in base-9, we get 12. However, in base-9, we only have digits up to 8, so we need to "carry over" to the next place value.

Since 8+1=9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 6, and add the carried-over 1 from the previous column. 8+6+1=15, so we write down the digit 6 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are the carried-over 1 and the digit 0. 1+0=1, so we write down the digit 1 in the leftmost column.\n\nTherefore, 88+61=150 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{150}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 52 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In 52, there are no nines, so we can just copy the digit from 73. In base-9, 7+0=7, so we write down 7 as the digit in the nines place of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 52+73= \\boxed{75} in base-9.

To add 40 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nines place, which are 4 and 6 (since 40 is 4 nines and 63 is 6 nines). Adding these digits gives us 12 in base-9, but we need to carry over to the next digit again. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place, which are 0 and 1 (since 40 is less than 81 and 63 is greater than 81). Adding these digits gives us 1 in base-9. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n 40\n+63\n---\n103\n\nTherefore, 40+63 in base-9 is \\boxed{103}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 67 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 4. In base-9, 7+4=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 4, and add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 6+4+1=12, so we write down 2 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over digit of 1 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 62 and 50 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 0. Since 2+0=2, we write down 2 as the units digit of the result. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9's place, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11, we have to carry over 1 to the next place value. So we write down 2 (the ones digit of 11) in the 9's place of the result, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which are 1 (the carry-over) and 0. Since 1+0=1, we write down 1 in the 81's place of the result. \n\nTherefore, 62+50 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{121}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 12 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 2. Since 8+2=10 in base-9, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n8 + 2 = 10 (in base-9)\n10 - 9 = 1 (carry-over)\n1 + 6 + 1 = 8\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 1, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 66 and 33 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 6 and 3. In base-9, 6+3=12, but since we only have digits up to 8, we need to carry over to the next digit. So we write down 2 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are both 6 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step plus the original 6 in 66). 6+6+1 (the carried-over 1) = 13. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we write down 4 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step plus the original 3 in 33). 0+0+1=1. \n\nSo the result is 144 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{144}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 86 and 35 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, this means that we write down the digit 2 (which is 11 in base-9) and carry over a digit of 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 8 and 3, and add the carried over digit of 1. This gives us 8+3+1=12 in base-10, which means we need to carry over a digit again. In base-9, this means we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry over a digit of 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is just 1, and add the carried over digit of 1. This gives us 1+1=2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 86+35=123 in base-9, which we can write as $\\boxed{123}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 52 and 66 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 6. In base-9, 2+6=8, which we write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 5 and 6. In base-9, 5+6=11, but we can't write "11" in the tens place because that is not a valid digit in base-9. Instead, we write "11" as "12" (since 1 ten and 2 ones is the same as 12 ones). \n\nSo the sum of 52 and 66 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{120}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 4. This gives us 4 in the units place of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9s place, which are 7 and 7 (since 70 and 74 both have a digit in the 9s place). This gives us 14, which is equivalent to 1 nine and 5 units. We write down the 5 in the 9s place of the sum, and carry the 1 over to the next place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place (since 70 and 74 both have a digit in this place). We add the carried-over 1 from the previous step to the sum of 7 and 4, which gives us 12. This is equivalent to 1 nine and 3 units. We write down the 3 in the 81s place of the sum, and carry the 1 over to the next place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we have our final answer: \n\n70 + 74 = 144 \n\nIn base-9, this is written as \\boxed{144}.

To add 80 and 26 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 6, with no carry-over to the next digit. Moving left, we add the next digits, which are 8 and 2. This gives us 10, which is equivalent to 1 nine and 1 unit. We write down the unit (which is 1) and carry-over the nine to the next digit. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 1. Therefore, 80+26 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{107}.

To add 72 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 8. In base-9, 2+8=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as "A" and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 1 (the carried-over digit). In base-9, 7+1=8, so we write 8 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 72+18 in base-9 is equal to 8A, which we box as our final answer: \\boxed{8A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 units in base-9. We write down the 2 as the digit in the tens place of the result, and carry the 1 over to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 1 (the carry-over from the previous step) and 0 (since neither 63 nor 33 has a digit in the hundreds place).

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 10+81? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert 10 and 81 into base-9. \n\n10 in base-9 is simply "11" (since 1 nine plus 1 is equal to 10). \n\nTo convert 81 into base-9, we need to find the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 81. That power is 81 itself, which is equal to 9^2. So, we start by dividing 81 by 9^2, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 0. This means that the leftmost digit in our base-9 representation of 81 is 1. \n\nNext, we take the remainder (which is 0) and divide it by the next smallest power of 9, which is 9^1. This gives us 0 with a remainder of 0, so the next digit in our base-9 representation is also 0. \n\nFinally, we take the remainder (which is still 0) and divide it by the smallest power of 9, which is 9^0 (which is just 1). This gives us 0 with a remainder of 0, so the last digit in our base-9 representation is also 0. \n\nTherefore, 81 in base-9 is "100". \n\nNow, we can add "11" and "100" in base-9. \n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 1+0=1, 1+0=1, and 0+1=1. So, the result is "111" in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 10+81 = \\boxed{111}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 4+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 3, and add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 6+3+1=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 1 in the nines place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is 1, and add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 in the eighty-ones place.\n\nTherefore, 64+37 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{102}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, this means that we add 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n  48\n+ 62\n----\n 110\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 6, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us:\n\n  48\n+ 62\n----\n 110\n+ 1\n----\n 121\n\nTherefore, 48+62 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{121}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nSo, we write down the digit 3 (which represents 12 in base-9) in the units place, and carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5 (the digits we carried over). In base-9, 7+5+1=13, but again, there is no digit for 13 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nSo, we write down the digit 4 (which represents 13 in base-9) in the tens place, and carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 (since there is no digit in the hundreds place for 75) and 1 (the digit we carried over).

To add 70 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 8, but we need to carry over to the next column since 8 is the ninth digit in base-9. So we write down 8 in the result and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nIn the next column, we add 1 (the carry-over) to 7 (the next digit in 70) and 5 (the next digit in 58). This gives us 13, which is the equivalent of 14 in base-10. However, we need to write this as a two-digit number in base-9, so we write down 5 (the remainder when dividing 14 by 9) and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nIn the last column, we add the carry-over (1) to the last digit in 70 (which is 7).

Since 6+7=13, we write down the digit 4 (which is 13 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 6 (the tens digits). We also add the carry-over digit from the previous column, which is 1. So we have 2+6+1=9. Since 9 is the largest digit in base-9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next column, which is the hundreds column. There is only one digit in this column for each number, which is 0 for 26 and 6 for 67. So we add 1+0+6=7. \n\nTherefore, 26+67=104 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 54+48? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 54 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 8. In base-9, 4+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 4, and we also add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 5+4+1=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 1 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and we also add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}1\\\\\n&\\underline{54}\\\\\n&\\phantom{0}48\\\\\n&\\underline{12}\\\\\n&102\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 54+48=102 in base-9, and the final answer is $\\boxed{102}$.

To add 66 and 53 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 3. \n\n6 + 3 = 9 \n\nSince 9 is the largest digit in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit. We represent 9 as 10 in base-9. \n\nSo, we carry over 1 to the next digit and add the next digits: \n\n1 + 6 + 5 = 12 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we represent 12 as 13 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 66 + 53 in base-9 is equal to 130 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 5+8=13, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 13 is one more than the largest digit in base-9, which is 8). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 2 and 4, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 2+4+1=7. \n\nTherefore, 25+48=73 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{73}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 62 and 35 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 5. In base-9, 2+5=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. In 62, there are no 9s, so we can just carry over the 0 to the next step. In 35, there are 3 9s, so we add 3 to the next step. \n\nNow we add the next digits, which represent 81s. In 62, there are no 81s, so we carry over the 0 to the next step. In 35, there are no 81s, so we carry over the 3 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the next digits, which represent 729s. In 62, there is 1 729, so we add 1 to the next step. In 35, there are no 729s, so we carry over the 0 to the next step. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  62\n+35\n---\n  100\n---\n\nSo 62+35 in base-9 is \\boxed{100}.

To add 64 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 5. In base-9, 4+5=8, which we write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. We have 6+5=11 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we can only use digits 0-8. So we need to "carry over" the extra 1 to the hundreds place. In the tens place, we write down the digit "2" (since 11-9=2). \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which is just 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  1\n 64\n+55\n---\n119\n\nTherefore, 64+55= \\boxed{119} in base-9.

In base-9, 2+7=11, but since we are using only one digit, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 and 1 (the carried-over digit). In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 in the next column.\n\nTherefore, 12+17=24 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{24}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 3+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place. We add the digits in the 9's place, which are 5 and 2, and then add the carry-over from the units place, which is 1.

To add 50 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 4. This gives us 4 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over happens when we reach the digit 9, which is represented by the digit "8" in our base-9 system. \n\nSo, we carry over 1 to the next digit and add the next digits, which are 5 and 7. Adding 1 to 5 gives us 6, and adding 7 gives us 14. However, we need to carry over again since 14 is greater than or equal to 9. We can represent 14 in base-9 as "16", so we carry over 1 to the next digit and write down the units digit, which is 6.\n\nFinally, we add the last digits, which are 0 and 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 1 in base-9. Therefore, \n\n50 + 74 = 124 in base-9 \n\nand the result is \\boxed{124}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 8+5=13, we write down the digit 4 (which is 13 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 5 and 6, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 12, which we write down as 3 (since 12 is equivalent to 3 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are both 0, and add the carry-over digit of 1.

To add 76 and 70 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 6+0=6 in the ones place. In base-9, 6 is simply represented as "6", so we write that down:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n   6\n```\n\nMoving to the next digit, we have 7+7=14 in the nines place. However, in base-9 we only have digits up to 8, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In other words, we subtract 9 from 14 to get 5, and carry over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 70\n----\n   6\n  15\n```\n\nFinally, in the third digit from the right, we have 1+0=1 in the nines-squared place.

To add 85 and 34 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 4. In base-9, 5+4=8, so we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. In 85, the tens digit is 8, and in 34, the tens digit is 3. Adding these in base-9 gives us 11. However, 11 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry over" to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over happens when we reach 9. Since 11 is two more than 9, we carry over 1 to the next digit. We write down the digit 2 as the tens digit of the sum, and subtract 9 from 11 to get 2 as the ones digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 85+34=112 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{112}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 60+77? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 60 and 77 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 7. This gives us 7 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the ninth place, which are both 6. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 13 in base-9. However, we can't write 13 as a single digit in base-9, so we need to carry over again. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81st place, which are both 7. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 15 in base-9. Again, we can't write 15 as a single digit in base-9, so we need to carry over one more time. \n\nThe final result is 135 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{135}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 28+80? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 28 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. Since 8+0=8, we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 2 in 28 and the 8 in 80. Since 2+8=10 in base-9, we write down 1 as the digit to the left of the 8, and carry over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 0 in 28 and 0 in 80. 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 28+80=108 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{108}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 60+66? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 60 and 66 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 6, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 6 is the same as 10 in base-9. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are both 0. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 1.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 6. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 14, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 14 is the same as 16 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, the final result is $\\boxed{107}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 34+72? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 34 and 72 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 2. In base-9, 4+2=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In 34, there are 3 nines, and in 72, there are 7 nines. Together, they make 10 nines, which is one more than the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we need to "carry over" one nine to the next digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over one nine to the next digit is the same as adding 1 to the next digit. So we add 1 to the sum of the next digits, which are 3 and 7. In base-9, 3+7=11, which is one more than the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we carry over one nine to the next digit again. \n\nFinally, we add the remaining digits, which are the hundreds digits. In 34, there are 3 nines squared, which is 243. In 72, there are 7 nines squared, which is 567. Together, they make 810, which is 9 nines squared. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 34 and 72 in base-9 is \\boxed{906}.

To add 36 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 8. Since 6+8=14, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 5, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 3+5+1=9, which is the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 80 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 8, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 8 is the ninth digit in base-9. So we write down 8 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 8 and 1 (the carried over digit). This gives us 0, but we need to carry over again since 9 is the tenth digit in base-9. So we write down 0 and carry over 1 again. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1 (the carried over digit). This gives us 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 72+61? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 72 and 61 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 1. In base-9, 2+1=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 9's digits, which are 7 and 6, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 7+6=14, which is greater than 8, so we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. We write down the units digit of 14, which is 5, and we carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the next digit, which is the 81's digit. There is only 1 digit left to add, which is the 81's digit of 1. We add the carry-over of 1 to 1, which gives us 2. \n\nTherefore, 72+61 in base-9 is equal to 250, which we write as \\boxed{250}.

To add 28 and 34 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 4. Since 8+4=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 2 and 3 (the carried-over digit from the previous step). 2+3=5, so we write down the tens digit 5. \n\nTherefore, 28+34=52 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{52}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 44 and 64 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 4 and give us 8. We write down the 8 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the 4 and 6, which gives us 12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to regroup this as 1 nine and 3 ones. We write down the 3 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the last column, we add the carried-over 1 to the 4 and 6, which gives us 11. Again, we regroup this as 1 nine and 2 ones, and write down the 2. \n\nTherefore, 44+64 in base-9 is equal to 123, which we write as \\boxed{123}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 58 and 82 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 2. This gives us 10 in base-9, but since we can only use digits 0-8, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nIn the next place value, we add the digits we carried over (which is 1) to the digits in that place value (which are 5 and 8). This gives us 14 in base-9, but again we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nFinally, in the third place value, we add the digit we carried over (which is 1) to the digit in that place value (which is 0). This gives us 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 58+82 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{130}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 88 and 30 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. Since 8+0=8, we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in the tens place. We add this to the 3 in the tens place of 30, which gives us 11 in base-9. However, we can't write down "11" as a digit in base-9, since the highest digit is 8. Instead, we write down a 1 in the tens place of the sum, and carry over the "1" to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over "1" to the leftmost digit, which is 0 in 30. This gives us 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 88+30 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{119}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 38 and 15 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 5. Since 8+5=13, we write down the digit 4 (which is 13 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 1 (the carried-over digit). We get 4, so we write down 4 in the second column. \n\nTherefore, 38+15=44 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{44}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

However, we cannot write 10 in base-9 because the largest digit is 8. Instead, we write 10 as 1*9 + 1. \n\nSo, we carry the 1 over to the hundreds place and add it to the digits there. Since there are no digits in the hundreds place, we simply write 1 in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 23+83 in base-9 is equal to 106. \n\n\\boxed{106}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 88 and 35 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 5. \n\n8 + 5 = 13 in base-10, but since we are working in base-9, we need to regroup. 13 is equal to 1 nine and 4 ones, so we write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 3, and we add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. \n\n8 + 3 + 1 = 12 in base-10, which is equal to 1 nine and 3 ones. We write down the 3 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which is just 1, and we add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. \n\n1 + 1 = 2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 88 + 35 = 123 in base-9, or \\boxed{123}.

In base-9, 1+5=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we have a digit for 9, which is represented by the digit 8. Adding the digits in the nines place, we have 2+7=9. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down the digit 0 in the nines place of the sum, and carry over the digit 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digit we carried over to the next place value, which is the nines squared place. In this case, there is no digit to add, so we simply write down the carried over digit, which is 1, in the nines squared place of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  21\n+ 75\n----\n 100\n\nTherefore, 21+75 in base-9 is \\boxed{100}.

So we write down a 6 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 3 (the carried-over digit). In base-9, 6+3=12, but again we need to carry over to the next digit since 12 is not a valid digit in base-9. So we write down a 3 in the tens place and carry over a 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are the carried-over 1 and the 0 (since there are no hundreds digits in either number). In base-9, 1+0=1, so we write down a 1 in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  61\n+35\n---\n  96\n\nTherefore, 61+35= \\boxed{96} in base-9.

To add 63 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. Since 3+6=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum. So we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 1 (the carried over digit). 6+1=7, so we write down a 7 in the next place value. \n\nTherefore, 63+16 in base-9 is equal to 70. \n\n\\boxed{70}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+6=11, but since there is no digit for 11 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the digits in that place as well as any carry-over from the units place. In this case, we have 3 (from 35) plus 2 (from the carry-over) plus 6 (from 26), which gives us 11. Again, we need to carry over to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which is just the carry-over from the previous step.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 20+74? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 20 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 4. This gives us 4 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nines place, which are 2 and 7 (since 20 is 2 nines and 74 is 7 nines). Adding these gives us 1 eight and 6 ones. But we also need to add the carry-over from the units place, which gives us 7 ones. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place, which are 0 and 0. We don't need to carry over anything from the previous step. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  20\n+ 74\n----\n 104\n\nSo 20+74 in base-9 is \\boxed{104}.

To add 65 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 7. Since 5+7=12, we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 2, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 6+2+1=9, which is written as the digit 0 and a carry-over digit of 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us a final result of 100 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 65+27= \\boxed{100}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 45 and 17 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 7. In base-9, 5+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 9's digits, which are 4 and 1. In base-9, 4+1+1=6. \n\nTherefore, 45+17 in base-9 is equal to 61. \n\n\\boxed{61}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 43 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 3 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 7 and 4, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 12, but we need to carry over again since 12 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 63 and 36 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. In base-9, 3+6=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 3 (the tens place). We also need to add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 6+3+1=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 1 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is the hundreds place. There is only one digit in this place value for both numbers, which is 0. We also need to add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the result of 63+36 in base-9 is \\boxed{201}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+6=11, but since there is no digit for 11 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the digits in that place as well as any carry-over from the units place. In this case, we have 8+3+1 (the carry-over) = 12. Again, since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe final place value is the 81's place, so we need to add the digits in that place as well as any carry-over from the previous step.

To add 70 and 76 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 6 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit since 6 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 7 (since we carried over a 1 from the units place). This gives us 14 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit since 14 is greater than or equal to 9. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 1 (since we carried over a 1 from the tens place).

To add 63 and 35 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 5. In base-9, 3+5=8, which we can write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the nine's place. However, neither 63 nor 35 have a digit in the nine's place, so we don't need to worry about carrying over any values. \n\nTherefore, the final result is "8" in the units place, and "0" in the nine's place. \n\nThus, 63+35= \\boxed{80}.

Since 12 is greater than 9, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carried-over 1.

Since 6+1=7 in base-9, we write down the digit 7 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 6 (the tens digits). We also need to add the carry-over digit from the previous column, which is 1. So we have 3+6+1=10 in base-9. Since 10 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry-over again. We write down the digit 1 in the tens column and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 0 and 1 (the carry-over digit).

Since 6+7=13, we write down the digit 4 (which is the remainder when 13 is divided by 9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 7 and 4 (plus the carry-over digit of 1). This gives us 12, which we write down as the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 0 and 1 (plus the carry-over digit of 1).

In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n6+4=10 (in base-9)\n10-9=1 (carry-over)\n1+8+2=11 (in base-9)\n\nTherefore, 86+24=112 in base-9, which we can write as $\\boxed{112}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to add the units column, which gives us 8. Then, we move to the next column, which is the 9s column. 7+1 (from carrying over) gives us 8, and 3+0 gives us 3.

To add 74 and 35 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 5. In base-9, 4+5=8, which we write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 7 and 3, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 7+3=10, but since we are working in base-9, we need to write this as "11" (since we don't have a digit for "10"). So we write "11" in the 9's place. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 74 and 35 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{113}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 36 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 6. Since 8+6=14, we need to carry-over a 1 to the next digit. Therefore, the units digit of our answer is 4, and we write down the carry-over of 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 6 and 3, and we add the carry-over of 1 from the previous step. 6+3+1=10, so we need to carry-over a 1 to the next digit. Therefore, the tens digit of our answer is 1, and we write down the carry-over of 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the hundreds digit, which is 0. 0+1=1, so the hundreds digit of our answer is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n68+36=104\n\nTherefore, the result in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We have 5+7=12 in base-10, but in base-9 we can only use digits 0-8. So we need to "carry over" a digit to the next place value. In base-9, 12 is equivalent to 13 (since 1*9 + 3 = 12). So we write down "3" in the tens place and carry over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried over the 1 from the tens place). In base-9, 1+0=1, so we write down "1" in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{128}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a 1 to the next place value. Therefore, the units digit of our sum is 4 and we carry-over a 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are both 7. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 7+7+1=15. Again, we need to carry-over a 1 to the next place value. Therefore, the tens digit of our sum is 6 and we carry-over a 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0.

To add 71 and 32 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 2. In base-9, 1+2=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In the number 71, there are 7 nines, and in the number 32, there are 3 nines. So we have a total of 10 nines. In base-9, we can't write the number 10 using a single digit, so we need to "carry over" to the next digit to the left. \n\nTo do this, we subtract 9 from the 10 nines, which gives us 1. We write down 1 as the nines digit of the sum, and carry over the remaining 1 to the next digit to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. We add the carried-over 1 to get a final result of 104 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 71+32= \\boxed{104}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to add the units column, which gives us 8+3=11. Since we are in base-9, we need to regroup 1, which means we write 11 as 02 (since 1+1=2 in base-9). \n\nNext, we add the nines column, which gives us 1+2=3. \n\nTherefore, 18+23= 02 3 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{02 3}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 6+6=12 in base-9, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carried-over 1.

So we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the nines place. \n\nNext, we add the nines digits, which are 4 and 2 (the digit in the nines place of 42 and the digit in the nines place of 28). We also add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 4+2+1=7, so we write down a 7 in the nines place. \n\nTherefore, 42+28 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{70}.

To add 37 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n7 + 6 = 14 (carry-over 1)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 1, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

This gives us 9, which is one unit in base-9 and one unit carried over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 6 (the digit in the tens place for 26 and the digit in the ones place for 63, respectively), and we add the carried-over unit from the previous column. This gives us 9 + 2 + 6 = 17. In base-9, 17 is written as 21, since 1 unit is carried over to the next column. \n\nTherefore, 26 + 63 = 21\\boxed{9}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 1, which we can write as "01" in base-9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 8 (since we are in base-9, there is no digit "9"). This gives us 16, which is equivalent to "21" in base-9 (since 1 nine can be carried over to the next place value). \n\nTherefore, 80+81 in base-9 is equal to "2101". \n\n\\boxed{2101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 58 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 8. This gives us 16, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe digit 16 in base-10 is equivalent to 17 in base-9 (since 16 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 7). So we write down the digit 7 and carry over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNow we add the digits in the next column, which are 5 and 8 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 14, which is also greater than 8, so we need to carry over again. \n\nThe digit 14 in base-10 is equivalent to 15 in base-9 (since 14 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 5). So we write down the digit 5 and carry over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 0 and 1 (plus the carried-over 1).

Since 8+1=9, we write down 0 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place, which are 6 and 6 (the carried-over 1 is added to the 6 in the tens place). 6+6=12, which is equivalent to 1*9+3. So we write down 3 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are the carried-over 1 and the 0 from the hundreds place in both numbers. 1+0+0=1. \n\nTherefore, 68+61=130 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 24 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 3. Since 4+3=7, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 2 and 7. Since 2+7=9, we have to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we subtract 9 from 2+7=9, which gives us 0, and add 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 24 and 73 in base-9 is 101. \n\n\\boxed{101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 66 and 33 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 6 and 3. In base-9, 6+3=12, but since we only have digits up to 8, we need to carry over to the next digit. So we write down 2 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are both 6 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step plus the original 6 in 66). 6+6+1 (the carried-over 1) = 13. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we write down 4 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step plus the original 3 in 33). 0+0+1=1. \n\nSo the result is 144 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{144}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 53 and 85 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 5. Since 3+5=8, we write down 8 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. In 53, there are no 9s, so we can just carry over the 0 to the next step. In 85, there is one 9, so we can write down 1 as the next digit of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the digits representing 81s. In 53, there are no 81s, so we carry over the 0 to the next step. In 85, there are 8 81s, so we write down 8 as the next digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{136}\n\nTherefore, 53+85 in base-9 is 136.

To add 75 and 83 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 3. \n\n5 + 3 = 8 \n\nSo the units digit of our answer is 8. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 7 and 8. \n\n7 + 8 = 15 \n\nIn base-9, we can't write the number 15 using a single digit, so we need to carry over to the next place value. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 15, which gives us 6, and then adding 1 to the next place value. \n\nSo the tens digit of our answer is 6, and we carry over 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (since 75 has no hundreds digit) and 1 (from the carry-over). \n\n0 + 1 = 1 \n\nSo the hundreds digit of our answer is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n75 + 83 = 161 \n\nTherefore, our final answer in base-9 is: \n\n\\boxed{161}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 5+4=8 in base-9, we write down the digit 8 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 7, and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. We get 6+7+1=14 in base-9. Since 14 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the digit 5 in the current column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the last column, which is the carry-over from the previous step and is equal to 1. Therefore, the final result is 155 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{155}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 6+1=7 in base-9, we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. We add the carry from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-9, we have to carry over the 1 to the next digit. We write down the digit 2 as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the carry from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits 6 and 5. Since 6+5+1=12 in base-9, we have to carry over the 1 to the next digit. We write down the digit 3 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 66+51=213 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{213}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 4+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 2 (the carried-over digit). In base-9, 8+2=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 0 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 (the carried-over digit) and 1. In base-9, 0+1=1. Therefore, the result of 84+27 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 7+1=8 in base-9, we write down the digit 8 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 4, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 6+4+1=11 in base-9. Since 11 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over again. We write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. We get 1+1=2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 67+41=208 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{208}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 88 in base-9, we first need to convert each number to base-10:\n\n- 76 in base-9 is equal to 7*9 + 6 = 69 in base-10\n- 88 in base-9 is equal to 8*9 + 8 = 80 in base-10\n\nNow we can add these two numbers in base-10:\n\n69 + 80 = 149\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-9. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 9 and keeping track of the remainders:\n\n- 149 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 5 (since 9*16 + 5 = 149)\n- 16 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 7\n- 1 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1\n\nSo the result in base-9 is 175:\n\n\\boxed{175}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 71 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 3. In base-9, 1+3=4, which we write as "4" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 7 and 6. In base-9, 7+6=13, but we can't write "13" in the tens place because that is a two-digit number. Instead, we write "4" in the tens place (which represents 4 nines), and carry-over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (from 71) and 1 (from the carry-over). In base-9, 0+1=1, which we write in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 71+63 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{141}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 3+7=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as "A" and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 8 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 8+6+1=15, but since we only have one digit, we write 15 as "E" and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next column, which is just the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n83\n+67\n---\nEA1\n\nThus, 83+67= \\boxed{EA1} in base-9.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 46 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 6. \n\n7 + 6 = 13, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit. 13 in base-10 is equivalent to 14 in base-9, so we write down 4 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 4, and add the carried-over 1: \n\n7 + 4 + 1 = 12, which is equivalent to 13 in base-9. We write down 3 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit: \n\n1 + 7 = 10, which is equivalent to 11 in base-9.

To add 44 and 87 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 7. \n\n4 + 7 = 11 in base-10, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-9, 11 is written as "12", so we write down the "2" and carry over the "1". \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 4 and 8, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step: \n\n4 + 8 + 1 = 13 in base-10, which is "14" in base-9. We write down the "4" and carry over the "1". \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 8, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step: \n\n0 + 8 + 1 = 9 in base-10, which is "10" in base-9. We write down the "0" and carry over the "1". \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the final carried-over digit: \n\n1 \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n44 + 87 = 131 in base-9 \n\nSo the answer is: \n\n\\boxed{131}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We add the carry from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the tens place: \n\n3 + 8 + 0 = 11 \n\nSince 11 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next place value. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 11, which gives us 2. We write down 2 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carry to the leftmost digits: \n\n1 + 0 = 1 \n\nSo the leftmost digit of our answer is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n33 + 84 = 117 \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{117}.

To add 67 and 38 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value.

Since 3+8=11, we write down 2 (the rightmost digit of 11) and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 2 and 5, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 73 and 77 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 7. In base-9, 3+7=10, but since we only have digits up to 8, we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 7 and 3 (the tens place). We also need to add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 7+3+1=11, but again we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down a 2 in the tens place and carry over a 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0.

To add 42 and 70 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 0. Since 2+0=2, we write down 2 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 7. Since 4+7=11, we have to carry over 1 to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over 1 means subtracting 9 from the sum and carrying over 1 to the next place value. So we write down 2 (the ones digit of 11-9) as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 (since 42 doesn't have a hundreds digit) and 1 (the carry-over from the tens place). 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 42+70 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{111}.

To add 83 and 80 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 80\n----\n```\n\nThe ones place (rightmost digit) adds up to 3+0=3, which we can write as "3" in base-9. The next place value is the nines place (one position to the left), which adds up to 8+3=11. However, since we are in base-9, we need to "carry over" the extra digit (1) to the next place value. So we write down "2" in the nines place and carry over the "1" to the next place value:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 80\n----\n   3\n  12\n```\n\nNow we add up the next place value, which is the eighty-ones place (two positions to the left). This adds up to 8+0+1=9, which we can write as "10" in base-9. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit (1) to the next place value:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 80\n----\n   3\n  12\n  10\n```\n\nFinally, we add up the highest place value, which is the nines squared place (three positions to the left).

To add 78 and 21 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n8+1 = 9, which becomes 0 in the units digit and we carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 2, plus the carry-over of 1. This gives us:\n\n7+2+1 = 10, which becomes 1 in the tens digit and we carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next column, which is just the carry-over of 1. This gives us:\n\n1+1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, 78+21 in base-9 is \\boxed{102}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 80 and 46 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 6, with no carrying. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 8 and 4. This gives us 12, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the remainder, which is 4, and carry over the quotient, which is 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (plus the carried-over 1 from the previous step). This gives us 2. \n\nTherefore, 80+46 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{246}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 40 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 2. This gives us 2 in base-9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 6. This gives us 10 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we cannot write the digit "10". Instead, we write it as "11" with a carry-over of 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the hundreds place, which gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 40+62 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{113}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 84+27? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 84 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 7. In base-9, 4+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 2 (the carried-over digit). In base-9, 8+2=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 0 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 (the carried-over digit) and 1. In base-9, 0+1=1. Therefore, the result of 84+27 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 53 and 76 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. In base-9, 3+6=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place. We add the digits in the 9's place, which are 5 and 7, and then add the carry-over from the units place, which is 1. In base-9, 5+7+1=13, but again, there is no digit for 13 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place. We add the digits in the 81's place, which are 0 and 0, and then add the carry-over from the 9's place, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 53+76=130 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 63 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the nines digit. In base-9, we can think of this as the digit representing 9^1. We add the 6 and 5 in this digit position, which gives us 11. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next digit to the left. So we write down 2 as the nines digit of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. We don't need to carry over anything in this step. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  63\n+ 51\n----\n 114\n\nSo 63+51 in base-9 is \\boxed{114}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 12 and 67 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 7. Since 2+7=9, which is one digit in base-9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 6, and add the carried-over digit of 1. We get 1+6+1=8, which is also one digit in base-9. We write down the digit 8 in the second column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 12+67 in base-9 is equal to 80. \n\n\\boxed{80}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 28 and 86 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 6. \n\n8 + 6 = 14 \n\nSince 14 is greater than 9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 14, which gives us 5, and then adding 1 to the next column. \n\nSo, the next column to the left is 2 + 8 + 1 = 11. \n\nAgain, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column, so we subtract 9 from 11 to get 2, and add 1 to the next column. \n\nThe final column to the left is just 1. \n\nTherefore, the result of 28 + 86 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{115}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 72 and 30 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 0. In base-9, 2+0=2. So the units digit of our answer is 2.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 3. In base-9, 7+3=10. However, we can't write "10" in base-9 because we only have digits 0-8. Instead, we write 10 as "11" (just like in binary, where 10 is written as "2"). So the tens digit of our answer is 1.\n\nTherefore, 72+30 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{102}.

To add 54 and 71 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 1. Since 4+1=5 in base-9, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 5 and 7, and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. This gives us 5+7+1=13 in base-9. Since 13 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the digit 5 in the current column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the last column, which are 1 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. This gives us 1+0+1=2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 54+71=125 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{125}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 64 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 3. Since 4+3=7, the units digit of the sum is 7. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 6 (since 64 and 63 both have a 6 in the tens place). Since 6+6=12, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0. We don't need to carry over anything from this place value. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 64\n+63\n---\n127\n\nTherefore, 64+63 in base-9 is \\boxed{127}.

To add 80 and 55 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n```\n\nIn the ones place, we have 0 + 5 = 5. Since 5 is less than 9, we write down 5 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n   5\n```\n\nIn the nines place, we have 8 + 5 = 13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-9 since the digits only go up to 8. Instead, we need to "carry" the extra 1 to the next place value. This means that we write down 4 in the nines place (since 13 - 9 = 4), and carry the 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n  45\n```\n\nIn the eighty-ones place, we have 1 + 0 = 1. Since 1 is less than 9, we write down 1 in the eighty-ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n 145\n```\n\nTherefore, 80 + 55 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{145}$.

To add 35 and 28 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 8. In base-9, 5+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over digit to the sum of the 9's digits. The 9's digit of 35 is 3, and the 9's digit of 28 is 3 as well. Adding the carry-over digit 1, we get 3+3+1=7 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, 35+28=62 in base-9, which we can write as $\\boxed{62}$.

To add 71 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 7 and 5. In base-9, 7+5=12, but we can't write down 12 as a single digit in base-9. Instead, we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the hundreds digit, which is 1.

We add 2 and 8, which gives us 10. However, in base-9, we only have digits up to 8, so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down a 0 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 and 1 (from the carry-over), giving us 1.

To add 85 and 34 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 4. In base-9, 5+4=8, so we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. In 85, the tens digit is 8, and in 34, the tens digit is 3. Adding these in base-9 gives us 11. However, 11 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry over" to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over happens when we reach 9. Since 11 is two more than 9, we carry over 1 to the next digit.

To add 53 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. \n\n3 + 4 = 7 \n\nSo the units digit of our answer is 7. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. \n\n5 + 7 = 12 \n\nIn base-9, we don't have a digit for 10, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\n12 in base-9 is equivalent to 13 in base-10. \n\nSo we write down the digit 3 in the tens place, and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits. \n\n1 + 0 = 1 \n\nSo the hundreds digit of our answer is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n53 + 74 = 121 \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{121}.

To add 25 and 68 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 8. Since 5+8=13, we write down the digit 4 (which is 13 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 2 and 6, and add the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us 2+6+1=9, which we write down as the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us 1, which we write down as the leftmost digit.\n\nTherefore, 25+68=104 in base-9, which we write as $\\boxed{104}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 50 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 8. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 5 in 50 and the 4 in 48. Adding these gives us 9, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit. So we write down 0 and carry over the 1. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0, and add the carried-over 1. This gives us 1. Therefore, 50+48 in base-9 is \\boxed{118}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 34 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 6. Since 4+6=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, this means that we subtract 9 from the sum and write down the remainder. So, 4+6=13 in base-9, which we write as 4 with a carry-over of 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 1 (the digits to the left of the units place). We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So, 3+1+1=5 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 34+16=50 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{50}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 74 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 4. This gives us 8, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 7 in 74 and the 4 in 44. Adding these gives us 11 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we can only use digits from 0 to 8. Therefore, we need to "carry over" the extra 1 to the next digit. \n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, we add the carried-over 1 to the 7 in 74 and the 0 in 44. This gives us 8. We write down 8 as the next digit in our answer. \n\nTherefore, 74+44 in base-9 is equal to 122 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{122}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 87 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 7. Since 8+7=15, we write down the digit 6 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 15 is one more than the largest digit in base-9, which is 8). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nines place, which are 6 and 8 (the carried-over digit from the units place). Since 6+8=14, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place, which are 1 (the carried-over digit from the nines place) and 0 (since there are no digits in the 81s place for either number).

Since 3+6=9, which is one digit in base-9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 8, and add the carried-over 1 from the previous column. 1+8+1=10, which is two digits in base-9. We write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which is just the carried-over digit 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 1\\,\\,\\, 3\\\\\n&+\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, 8\\,\\,\\, 6\\\\\n&\\underline{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 1\\,\\,\\, 0\\,\\,\\, 0\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 13+86 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{100}$.

In base-9, 2+7=11, but since we are using only one digit, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are the 2 in 22 and the 3 in 37, plus the carried-over 1. In base-9, 2+3+1=6, so we write down 6 in the next column.\n\nTherefore, 22+37=60 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{60}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 80 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 80\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 6+0=6. Writing 6 in the ones place, we carry-over 0 to the next column:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 80\n----\n   6\n```\n\nMoving to the next column, we have 7+8=15. However, since we are in base-9, we need to regroup when the sum is 9 or greater. 15 is equal to 1 group of 9 and 6 ones. We write down the 6 in the tens place, and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 80\n----\n  16\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next column, which gives us 1+0=1:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 80\n----\n  156\n```\n\nTherefore, 76+80 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{156}$.

In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum. So we write down a 0 in the units place and add 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 8 and 1 (the digits in the nines place). We also add the 1 that we carried over from the units place. 8+1+1=10, so we carry over another digit to the next place value. Again, we write down a 0 in the current place value and add 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is just 1 (the digit in the 81s place).

Therefore, we write down 2 (the units digit of 12) and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 4, and we also add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 5+4+1=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 1 (the units digit of 10) and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is the leftmost digit in each number. In this case, both numbers have a leftmost digit of 0, and we also add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the result.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & 1 & \\\\\n& & 5 & 3 & \\\\\n+ & & 4 & 6 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n& 1 & 2 & 1 & \\boxed{121} \\\\\n\\end{array} \n\nTherefore, 53+46=121 in base-9.

To add 44 and 38 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. \n\n4 + 8 = 12 \n\nSince we are in base-9, we need to regroup the 12 as 1 nine and 3 ones. So we write down the 3 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 4 and 3, and add the carried-over 1: \n\n4 + 3 + 1 = 8 \n\nSo the final result is 81 in base-9: \n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 56 and 57 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 7. In base-9, 6+7=13, but since there is no digit for 13 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 3 as the units digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 5 (since we carried-over 1 from the units place). In base-9, 5+5=11, but again, there is no digit for 11 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the tens digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 1 (since we carried-over 1 from the tens place). In base-9, 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{121}\n\nTherefore, 56+57 in base-9 is equal to 121.

To add 13 and 57 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 7. Since 3+7=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n3+7=10, which becomes 1 in the units digit and we carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 (the carry-over) and 1 (the tens digit of 13). This gives us 2.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 5 (the tens digit of 57) and 0 (there is no hundreds digit in 13).

To add 50 and 42 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 2. This gives us 2 in base-9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 4. This gives us 11 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we cannot have a digit greater than 8. Therefore, we need to "carry over" the extra digit to the next place value. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down 1 in the next place value (the hundreds place) and subtract 9 from the 11 we got earlier. This gives us 2 in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, the final result is 92 in base-9: \n\n50 + 42 = 92 \n\n\\boxed{92}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 46 and 85 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 11 in base-9 as 12 (since 11=1*9+2). Therefore, we write down 2 as the units digit and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 4 and 8, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 4+8+1=13 in base-10. We regroup 13 as 14 in base-9 (since 13=1*9+4), so we write down 4 as the digit in the next column and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just 1 (the carry-over from the previous step) and write it down as the leftmost digit.

To add 61 and 71 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nine's place, which are 6 and 7. In base-9, 6+7=13, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down 13-9=4 as the digit in the nine's place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 0 (since neither number has a digit in this place value). The sum is 1. \n\nTherefore, 61+71=104 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 12 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 8. Since 2+8=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n  1\n 12\n+18\n---\n  31\n\nTherefore, 12+18 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{31}.

In base-9, 5+6=11, but since there is no digit for 11 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe digit for 11 in base-9 is 12, which we write as "10" with a carry-over of 1. So, we write down a "0" in the units place and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 5+4+1=10, which we write as "11" with a carry-over of 1. So, we write down a "1" in the tens place and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1, to the digit in the hundreds place, which is 0. In base-9, 1+0=1, so we write down a "1" in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 55+46=101 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 9's digits, which are 8 and 7, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 8+7=15, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. The digit 15 in base-9 is written as "16", so we write down 6 as the 9's digit of the sum, and we carry-over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next place value, which is the 81's digit. In this case, there is no carry-over, so we simply copy the 8 from 82 and write it as the 81's digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 82+73 in base-9 is equal to 156, which we write as \\boxed{156}.

To add 55 and 40 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 0. This gives us 5. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. Here, we have 5 and 4. Adding these gives us 8, but since 8 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to "carry over" to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over from 8 to the next digit is the same as adding 1. So we write down 8 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}5\\phantom{0}\\\\\n&+40\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&\\boxed{85}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 55+40 in base-9 is \\boxed{85}.

In base-9, 7+4=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 6, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step. In base-9, 8+6+1=15, but again, there is no digit for 15 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value.

However, 14 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over 1 from the tens place to the next place value is the same as adding 9.

In base-9, 1+4=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 8. In base-9, 3+8=12, but since there is no digit for 9, we carry over the extra digit to the next place value. So we write down the digit 3 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over the digit 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 1 and the carried-over digit 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down the digit 2 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n31\n+ 84\n----\n115\n\nTherefore, 31+84 in base-9 is \\boxed{115}.

To add 54 and 46 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 6. In base-9, 4+6=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 4, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 5+4+1=10, but again, there is no digit for 10 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 1 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}54\\\\\n&+\\phantom{0}46\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&110_{9}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $54+46=110$ in base-9, and the final answer is $\\boxed{110_{9}}$.

To add 52 and 38 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 8. In base-9, 2+8=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as "A". \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 3, and we add 1 from the "carry" of the units digit. In base-9, 5+3+1=11, but again we only have one digit, so we write 11 as "B". \n\nTherefore, 52+38 in base-9 is "BA", which is equivalent to 81 in base-10. \n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 31 and 60 in base-9, we first align the digits:\n\n  31\n+ 60\n----\n  \nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 1 and 0, which gives us 1. We then move to the next digit to the left, and add 3 and 6, which gives us 12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. So we write down 3 and carry over 1. Moving to the next column, we add the carried over 1 to 1, which gives us 2. So the final result is:\n\n  31\n+ 60\n----\n  101\n\nTherefore, 31+60 in base-9 is \\boxed{101}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 2+1=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of our result. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. There are no 9s in either number, so we simply carry over the 1 from the previous step. \n\nFinally, we add the digits representing 9^2 (81s). Again, there are no 81s in either number, so we carry over the 1 from the previous step. \n\nOur final result is 124 in base-9, which we write as \\boxed{124}.

To add 25 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 4. Since 5+4=11 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, this means that we write 2 in the units place and carry over 1 to the nines place. \n\nNext, we add the nines digits, which are 2 and 4 (since we carried over 1 from the units place). 2+4=6, so we write 6 in the nines place. \n\nTherefore, 25+44=66 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{66}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 9's digits, which are 8 and 8. In base-9, 8+8=16, but again, there is no digit for 16 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 81's digits, which are 0 and 1. In base-9, 0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 85+87=101 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 88 in base-9, we first need to convert each number to base-10:\n\n- 76 in base-9 is equal to 7*9 + 6 = 69 in base-10\n- 88 in base-9 is equal to 8*9 + 8 = 80 in base-10\n\nNow we can add these two numbers in base-10:\n\n69 + 80 = 149\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-9. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 9 and keeping track of the remainders:\n\n- 149 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 5 (since 9*16 + 5 = 149)\n- 16 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 7\n- 1 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1\n\nSo the result in base-9 is 175:\n\n\\boxed{175}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 78 and 23 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 3. Since 8+3=11, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 2, and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. We get 10, so we write down 1 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which is 1, and the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. We get 2, so we write down 2 in the leftmost column. \n\nTherefore, 78+23=101 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 36 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 2. This gives us 8 in base-9. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the 9's digit. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the 9's digits, which are 3 and 6. This gives us 9 in base-9, but since 9 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to "carry-over" to the next digit. \n\nSo we write down a 0 in the 9's digit and carry-over a 1 to the next digit, which is the 81's digit. We add the carry-over (which is 1) to the 81's digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 7 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 36+62 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{107}.

We write down the 2 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 5 and 6, and add the carried-over 1. \n\n5 + 6 + 1 = 12 \n\nAgain, we regroup the 12 as 1 hundred and 3 tens. We write down the 3 tens and carry over the 1 hundred to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over hundred). \n\n0 + 1 = 1 \n\nSo, 54 + 67 in base-9 is equal to 121. \n\n\\boxed{121}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 45 and 35 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 5. In base-9, 5+5=11, but since we can only use digits 0-8, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So we write down 1 as the result for the current column and carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 4 and 3, and add the carried over 1 from the previous column. In base-9, 4+3+1=12, but again we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So we write down 2 as the result for the current column and carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0, and add the carried over 1 from the previous column.

To add 83 and 35 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 5.

We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 3 (since we carried over a 1 from the units place). In base-9, 8+3=12, which is greater than 9. So we need to carry over a 1 to the next place to the left, which is the 81s place. We write a "3" in the nines place (since 12-9=3), and carry over a 1 to the 81s place. \n\nIn the 81s place, we add the digits 1 and 8 (since we carried over a 1 from the nines place).

To add 41 and 83 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 3.

In base-9, 4+8=12, which is equal to 1*9+3. So we write down the 3 as the 81's digit of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carried-over 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 41+83=124 in base-9, which we write as \\boxed{124}.

This gives us 10, which is equal to 1 hundred and 1 ten in base-9. We write down the 1 in the tens column and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which is just the carried-over 1.

To add 53 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 8. In base-9, 3+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the units digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 8, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 5+8+1=14, but since there is no digit for 14 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 5 as the digit in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is 1 (the carry-over digit from the previous step) and get 1.

To add 71 and 36 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 6. Since 1+6=7 in base-9, we write down the digit 7 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 3 (the digit in the tens place for 71 and 36, respectively), and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. We get 7+3+1=11 in base-9. Since 11 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the digit 3 (11-9) in the current column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 1 and 0 (the digit in the hundreds place for 71 and 36, respectively), and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1.

In base-9, 5+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the digits in that place as well as the carry-over from the units place. In base-9, 1+8+7=16, but again, there is no digit for 16 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place, so we need to add the digits in that place as well as the carry-over from the 9's place.

To add 15 and 76 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 6. Since 5+6=11 in base-10, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, this means that we write down 2 (which is 11 in base-9) and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 1 and 7, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 1+7+1=9 in base-10, which is equivalent to 10 in base-9. We write down 0 in this place value and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which is 1, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 83 and 71 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 9's digits, which are 8 and 7, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 8+7=16, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. We write down the units digit of 16, which is 7, and we carry-over the digit 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next digit to the left, which is the 81's digit. In this case, there is no carry-over, so we simply add the 8 and 7. In base-9, 8+7=15, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. We write down the units digit of 15, which is 6, and we carry-over the digit 1 to the next step. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over digit as the leftmost digit of the sum.

In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 0 as the second digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit, which is 1.

We get 7+4+1=12. Since 12 is greater than 8, we write down the remainder of 12 divided by 9, which is 3, in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

Adding the digits in the nines place of 43 and 81, we get 4+8=12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value. 12 in base-9 is written as 13, so we write down 3 as the digit in the nines place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value, which represents the nines squared place.

To add 70 and 37 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 7. This gives us 7 in base-9. We then move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. In this case, both numbers have a digit in the 9s place, so we add them together along with any carry-over from the previous step. 7+3=10, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. So, we write down a 1 in the 81s place and put a 0 in the 9s place. Finally, we add the digits in the 81s place, which are 0 and 0 (plus any carry-over from the previous step). This gives us 0 in the 81s place. Therefore, 70+37=107 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{107}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 24 and 38 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 2 and 3 (the carried-over digit from the previous step). 2+3=5, so we write down the tens digit 5. \n\nTherefore, 24+38=62 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{62}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 47 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 2. \n\n7 + 2 = 9 \n\nSince 9 is not a digit in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 and adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 4 and 6, and add the carried-over 1. \n\n4 + 6 + 1 = 11 \n\nAgain, 11 is not a digit in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down a 2 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digit in the hundreds place, which is 1, and the carried-over 1. \n\n1 + 1 = 2 \n\nSo the result of 47+62 in base-9 is \\boxed{202}.

To add 36 and 53 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 3. Since 6+3=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  36\n+ 53\n----\n  01\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 5, and add the carry-over of 1. We get:\n\n```\n  36\n+ 53\n----\n  01\n  9\n----\n  12\n```\n\nFinally, we have the result of 36+53 in base-9: \n\n$$\\boxed{12}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 22 and 37 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 7. In base-9, 2+7=11, but since we are using only one digit, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are the 2 in 22 and the 3 in 37, plus the carried-over 1. In base-9, 2+3+1=6, so we write down 6 in the next column.\n\nTherefore, 22+37=60 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{60}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 81 and 61 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 8 and 6. In base-9, 8+6=14, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the remainder of 14 divided by 9, which is 5, and carry over the quotient of 14 divided by 9, which is 1. \n\nNow we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit from the left, which is 1. In base-9, 1+1+1=3, so we write down 3 as the next digit of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0. In base-9, 0+0=0, so we write down 0 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  81\n+ 61\n----\n 142\n\nTherefore, 81+61=142 in base-9, and we write the result as \\boxed{142}.

To add 27 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, we write down the digit 6 (which is 15 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 4, and add the carry-over digit of 1.

We add the 5 and 7, and we get 12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. 12 in base-10 is equivalent to 13 in base-9, so we write down 3 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over 1 to the next digit, which represents 81s. We have 1+ 7 + 2 = 10. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit. 10 in base-10 is equivalent to 11 in base-9, so we write down 2 and carry over 1. \n\nWe have no more digits to add, so our final answer is $\\boxed{220}$ in base-9.

We add 2 and 8, which gives us 10. However, in base-9, we only have digits up to 8, so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down a 0 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 and 1 (from the carry-over), giving us 1.

To add 56 and 35 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 11 in base-9 as 12 (since 11 is one more than the largest digit, which is 8). So we write down 2 as the units digit of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 5 and 3, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 5+3+1=9 in base-10, which we write as 10 in base-9 (since 9 is the largest digit). So we write down 0 as the digit in the second column of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So we write down 1 as the digit in the third column of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  56\n+ 35\n----\n  12\n  01\n  1 \n----\n  48\n\nTherefore, 56+35=48 in base-9, and we write our final answer as $\\boxed{48}$.

To add 73 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. We have 7+5=12 in base-10, but we need to convert this to base-9. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 9 and keeping track of the remainders. \n\n12 divided by 9 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 3. So we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 0. In base-9, 1+0=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n73\n+ 51\n----\n124\n\nSo 73+51 in base-9 is \\boxed{124}.

Therefore, we write down 2 as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nFinally, we have a total of 1 in the hundreds place (from carrying over), so we add that to the sum of the hundreds digits, which are both 0.

Adding these gives us 15 in base-9. However, 15 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry over" to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over from 15 means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 6 (the remainder of 15 when divided by 9) and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 1. Therefore, 80+77=156 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{156}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 72 and 84 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 4. In base-9, 2+4=6, which we can write as "6" in the units place. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the tens place. In 72, the digit in the tens place is 7, and in 84, the digit in the tens place is 8. In base-9, 7+8=15, but we can't write "15" in the tens place because that is a two-digit number. Instead, we need to "carry over" the extra digit to the next place value. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over happens when we add two digits that sum to 9 or more. When we carry over, we subtract 9 from the sum and add 1 to the next place value. So in this case, we carry over the 1 to the hundreds place, and write a 6 in the tens place (since 15-9=6). \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place. In 72, the digit in the hundreds place is 0, and in 84, the digit in the hundreds place is 1 (because we carried over the 1 from the tens place).

To add 72 and 23 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In the number 72, there are 7 nines, and in the number 23, there are 2 nines. So we have a total of 7+2=9 nines.

In the number 72, there are no 81s, and in the number 23, there are 2 81s. We also need to add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. So we have a total of 2+1=3 81s.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 66+76? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 66 and 76 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 6. This gives us 12 in base-9, which is equivalent to 13 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. Therefore, we write down the digit 3 and carry over the digit 1.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 6 and 7, and add the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us a total of 14 in base-9, which is equivalent to 15 in base-10. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column, so we write down the digit 6 and carry over the digit 1.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are the carried-over digit of 1 and the digit 0. This gives us a total of 1 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 in base-10.\n\nTherefore, 66+76 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{163}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 61 and 28 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. In base-9, 1+8=10, but since we only have one digit, we write down 1 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 2, and add the carried-over 1. In base-9, 6+2+1=14, but since we only have one digit, we write down 5 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just 1, and add the carried-over 1. In base-9, 1+1=2. \n\nTherefore, 61+28= \\boxed{102}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 20 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 0. In base-9, 2+0=2. So the rightmost digit of our answer is 2.\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. In 82, there are no 9's, so we just add the 2 from 20. 2+0=2. So the 9's digit of our answer is 2.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digit, which is the 8. But we also need to carry over the 1 from the previous step, since 2+2+1=5, and 5 is the base-9 representation of 14. In base-9, 8+1=10, which is represented as "11" in base-9. So the leftmost digit of our answer is 1, and we carry over the "1" to the next digit.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 46 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 6. \n\n7 + 6 = 13, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit. 13 in base-10 is equivalent to 14 in base-9, so we write down 4 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 4, and add the carried-over 1: \n\n7 + 4 + 1 = 12, which is equivalent to 13 in base-9. We write down 3 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit: \n\n1 + 7 = 10, which is equivalent to 11 in base-9.

To add 26 and 14 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=10 in base-9, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n6+4=10 (in base-9)\n10-9=1 (carry-over)\n1+2+1=4\n\nTherefore, 26+14=40 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{40}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 34 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 3 and 5, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 3+5+1=9, which is the maximum digit in base-9. Therefore, we write down the tens digit 0 and carry-over the hundreds digit 1.\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 0+0+1=1.\n\nTherefore, 34+58=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 67 and 43 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 3. Since 7+3=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, this means that we add 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  67\n+ 43\n----\n 110\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 4, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us:\n\n```\n  67\n+ 43\n----\n 110\n+  1\n----\n 121\n```\n\nTherefore, 67+43 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{121}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We add the 9's digits, which are 6 and 4, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 11 in base-9. However, we cannot write 11 in base-9 because the highest digit is 8. Therefore, we need to "carry-over" the extra 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the next digit, which is the 81's digit.

In base-9, 4+1=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 7 and 4, and also any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 7+4=12, which is greater than 8, so we need to carry-over to the next digit. We write down the digit 3 (which is 12-9) as the 9's digit of the sum, and carry-over the digit 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit (1) to the next digit to the left, which is the 81's digit. We add the 1, 0, and 4, and get 5. We write down the digit 5 as the 81's digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 74+41=135 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{135}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 85 in base-9, we first need to convert each number to base-10:\n\n70 in base-9 is equal to 7*9^1 + 0*9^0 = 63\n85 in base-9 is equal to 8*9^1 + 5*9^0 = 77\n\nNow we can add these two numbers in base-10:\n\n63 + 77 = 140\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-9:\n\n140 = 15*9^1 + 5*9^0 = 155\n\nTherefore, 70+85 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{155}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 13+56? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 13 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. Since 3+6=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  1\n 13\n+56\n---\n  0\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 1 and 5, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get:\n\n```\n  1\n 13\n+56\n---\n  10\n```\n\nSince 10 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to carry over again. We subtract 9 from 10 and add 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  1\n 13\n+56\n---\n  01\n```\n\nTherefore, 13+56 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{01}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 88 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, which is one digit in base-9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 5, and add the carried-over digit of 1. We get 8+5+1=14, which is two digits in base-9. We write down the rightmost digit, which is 4, and carry-over the leftmost digit, which is 1, to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 1 and 0, and add the carried-over digit of 1. We get 1+0+1=2, which is one digit in base-9. We write down the digit 2 in the leftmost column.\n\nTherefore, 88+51 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{140}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=12, we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 4, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 12 again, which we write down as the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us a final result of 4 in the third column. \n\nTherefore, 76+44= \\boxed{343} in base-9.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 86 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 6. Since 6+6=12, we write down the rightmost digit 2 and carry-over the leftmost digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 8 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 8+1=9, so we write down the rightmost digit 0 and carry-over the leftmost digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place from the right, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 0+1=1, so we write down the rightmost digit 1. \n\nTherefore, 86+16=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 57 and 36 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over happens when the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 9. So we write down the digit 4 in the units place, and carry-over the digit 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 3, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 5+3+1=9, which is equal to the base of our number system. Therefore, we need to carry-over another digit to the next place value. We write down the digit 0 in the tens place, and carry-over the digit 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. We get 1, which we write down in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 57+36=104 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 57 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 7. In base-9, 6+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 7+5+1=13, but again, there is no digit for 13 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 4 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}76\\\\\n&+57\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&134\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 76+57 in base-9 is \\boxed{134}.

To add 64 and 72 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 2. In base-9, 4+2=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents 9s. In 64, there are no 9s, so we can just write down the digit from 72, which is 7. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since 4+2=6 and 6 is one more than 5, the largest digit in base-9). We add this carry-over to the digit in the next column to the left, which represents 81s. In this case, both numbers have a digit in this column of 0, so we just write down the carry-over as the digit in this column of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  64\n+72\n---\n 136\n\nSo 64+72 in base-9 is \\boxed{136}.

To add 60 and 77 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 7. This gives us 7 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the ninth place, which are both 6. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 13 in base-9. However, we can't write 13 as a single digit in base-9, so we need to carry over again. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81st place, which are both 7. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 15 in base-9. Again, we can't write 15 as a single digit in base-9, so we need to carry over one more time. \n\nThe final result is 135 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{135}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 84 and 23 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 3. In base-9, 4+3=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. There are no 9s in either number, so we simply carry over the 0 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place, which represents 81s. There are 8 81s in 84, and 2 81s in 23. In base-9, 8+2=11, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 1 unit. We write the 1 in the 81s place, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }_{\\boxed{1}}\\phantom{ }7\\phantom{ }0\\\\\n&\\underline{+\\phantom{ }8\\phantom{ }4}\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }9\\phantom{ }1\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 84+23 in base-9 is $\\boxed{91}$.

To add 63 and 70 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 0. Since 3+0=3, we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 7. Since 6+7=13, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0 (since 63 and 70 have no hundreds). We add the carried-over 1 to get 1. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 63 and 70 in base-9 is 134. \n\n\\boxed{134}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 62 and 37 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 7. In base-9, 2+7=11, but since there is no digit for 11 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we add the digits in that place: 6 and 3. In base-9, 6+3=12, which is also too large for a single digit in base-9. So we carry over again to the next place value, which is the 81's place.\n\nIn the 81's place, we add the digits 1 (from the carry-over) and 0 (since there are no digits in the 81's place for 62 and 37). This gives us 1.\n\nSo the final result is 1 in the 81's place, 2 in the 9's place, and 0 in the units place, or $\\boxed{120}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

So we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 4 and 1 (the digit we carried over). 4+1=5, so we write down a 5 in the next place value. \n\nTherefore, 42+18 in base-9 is equal to 50. \n\n\\boxed{50}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 6+4=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 7 and 3, plus the carried-over digit 1. This gives us 11 in base-9, which we write down as the tens digit 2 and carry-over the hundreds digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (since 76 has no hundreds digit) and 1 (the carried-over digit from the previous step). This gives us 1 in base-9, which we write down as the hundreds digit 1. \n\nTherefore, 76+34=110 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{110}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 7 and 5 (the 1 we carried over from the previous step plus the digit in the second place from the left). 7+5=12, which is also greater than 8, so we carry over 1 to the next digit. We write down 3 as the second digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place from the right, which are 1 (the 1 we carried over from the previous step) and 0 (since there are no digits in the third place from the left in 58). 1+0=1, so we write down 1 as the third digit of the sum.\n\nTherefore, 77+58=135 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{135}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 12 and 82 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  12\n+ 82\n----\n```\n\nIn the ones place, we have 2+2=4, which we can write as 4 in base-9. In the nines place, we have 1+8=9, which is one group of nine, so we write down a 0 in the nines place and carry the 1 over to the next place:\n\n```\n  12\n+ 82\n----\n   4\n  10\n```\n\nIn the nines-squared place, we have 1+0=1, so we write down a 1 in that place:\n\n```\n  12\n+ 82\n----\n  14\n  10\n```\n\nTherefore, 12+82 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{104}$.

In base-9, 1+4=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we can think of this as the "tens" place. We add the digits in this place, which are 2 and 8. In base-9, 2+8=10, but we can't write down the digit 10 in a single digit place. Instead, we write down the digit 1 in the nines place (since 10 is one more than 9), and carry over the digit 0 to the next place to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place to the left, which represents the nines squared place (or the "hundreds" place in base-10). There is only one digit in this place for both numbers, which is 0. We add 0+0=0, and write down the digit 0 in the nines squared place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 2\\,\\,\\, 1_{9}\\\\\n&+\\,\\,\\, 8\\,\\,\\, 4_{9}\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&\\quad\\, 1\\,\\,\\, 5_{9}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 21+84 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{15_9}$.

The result in the units place is therefore 10-9=1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are both 2. 2+2=4 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 22+18=41 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{41}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 23 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 7. In base-9, 3+7=10, but since there is no digit for 10 in base-9, we carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 2 and 2, and we add the carried-over 1. In base-9, 2+2+1=5. \n\nTherefore, 23+27=50 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{50}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 71+27? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 71 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 7. Since 1+7=8, we write down the digit 8 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 7 and 2. Since 7+2=9, we have to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down the digit 0 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit to the hundreds digit, which is 1. 1+1=2, so we write down the digit 2 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 71+27=1008 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{1008}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 88+38? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 88 and 38 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 8. This gives us 16, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe digit 16 in base-9 is equivalent to 17 in base-10. To convert this back to base-9, we divide 17 by 9 and get a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 8. So the rightmost digit of our sum is 8, and we carry over the 1 to the next digit.\n\nNow we add the next digits, which are 8 and 3 (plus the carry-over of 1). This gives us 12, which is also greater than 8, so we need to carry over again. \n\nThe digit 12 in base-9 is equivalent to 13 in base-10. To convert this back to base-9, we divide 13 by 9 and get a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 4. So the second digit from the right of our sum is 4, and we carry over the 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0 (plus the carry-over of 1). This gives us 1, which is less than 9, so we don't need to carry over.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{126}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 31 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. In base-9, 1+8=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as 1 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 1 (the tens digits). We also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 3+1+1=5. \n\nTherefore, 31+18=50 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{50}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 41 and 75 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 5. In base-9, 1+5=6, which we write as "6" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 4 and 7. In base-9, 4+7=12, but we can't write "12" in base-9 because the digit "9" doesn't exist. Instead, we write "12" as "13", where the "1" carries over to the hundreds place and the "3" is written in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, 41+75 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 4. Since 8+4=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 6 and 7, plus the carried-over digit 1. This gives us 14 in base-9, which we write down as the tens digit 5 and carry-over the hundreds digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digit 1 to the carried-over digit 1, which gives us 2 in base-9. We write down the result as \\boxed{252}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 64 and 68 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 3 (which represents 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 6 and the carried-over 1. 6+1=7, so we write down the digit 7 in the second column from the right. \n\nTherefore, 64+68=131 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{131}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 31 and 87 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 7. In base-9, 1+7=8, so we write down 8 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 3 and 8. In base-9, 3+8=12, but since there is no digit for "12" in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, 12 is equivalent to 1 ten and 3 units, so we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (since 31 is less than 100) and 1 (the carry-over from the tens place). In base-9, 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  31\n+ 87\n----\n 118\n\nTherefore, 31+87 in base-9 is \\boxed{118}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 41+82? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 41 and 82 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  41\n+ 82\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 1 and 2, which gives us 3. Since 3 is less than 9, we write it down as is:\n\n```\n  41\n+ 82\n----\n   3\n```\n\nMoving to the next digit, we add 4, 8, and the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0), giving us 12. However, 12 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "regroup" it as 1 group of 9 and 3 remaining:\n\n```\n  41\n+ 82\n----\n  13\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which gives us 1. Writing this down, we get:\n\n```\n  41\n+ 82\n----\n 113\n```\n\nTherefore, 41+82 in base-9 is $\\boxed{113}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 55 and 41 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. In base-9, 5+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. We add the digits in this place, which are both 5. In base-9, 5+5=11, but we can't write down the digit 11 in a single digit place. Instead, we write down the digit 2 in the nines place (representing 18), and carry-over the digit 1 to the next place to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit 1 to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines squared place. The digits in this place are 0 and 4. In base-9, 1+0+4=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the nines squared digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 55+41=206 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{206}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. We add the digits in this place, which are 4 and 7, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 4+7=12, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place to the left. The digit 12 in base-9 is represented as "14", so we write down the digit 4 in the nines place of the sum, and we carry-over the digit 1 to the next place to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next place to the left, which is the nines-squared place. There is no digit in this place for either of the numbers we are adding, and the carry-over digit is 1, so we write down the digit 1 in the nines-squared place of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 45+71 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{106}.

To add 56 and 60 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 0. Since 6+0=6, we write down 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9's place, which are 5 and 6. Since 5+6=11, we have to carry-over 1 to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the digit in the 9's place of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which are 0 and 0.

Since 6+7=13, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0 (since 63 and 70 have no hundreds).

In base-10, we would carry over a 1, but in base-9, we carry over a 10, which is represented by the digit "A". \n\nSo, we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over the A to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5, and add the carried over A. \n\n7 + 5 + A = 12 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value, which is represented by the digit "A". \n\nSo, we write down a 2 in the tens place and carry over the A to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and the carried over A. \n\n0 + A = A \n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n78 + 52 = \\boxed{A2A}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 66 and 14 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9, so we carry over to the next digit only when we reach 9. Therefore, we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 6+1=7, so we write down a 7 in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, 66+14=80 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{80}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 22 and 83 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. Since 2+3=5, we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. We add 2 and 8, which gives us 10. However, in base-9, we cannot write 10 as a single digit. Instead, we write down 1 in the tens place and carry-over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 1+0+8=9.

To add 36 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 8. Since 6+8=14, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 5, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 3+5+1=9, which is the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 75 and 77 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 7. In base-9, 5+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we add the digits in that place: 7+7=14. Again, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place (9x9), so we add the digits in that place: 1+5+7=13. Once again, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 729's place (9x9x9), so we add the digits in that place: 1+1=2. \n\nTherefore, 75+77 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{202}$.

To add 81 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 5. In base-9, 1+5=6, which we write as "6" in the units place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9's place, which are 8 and 5. In base-9, 8+5=13, which is greater than 9. So we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next place value. We write down the remainder, which is 4, in the 9's place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place and the 55's place, which are both 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 81\\\\\n&+55\\\\\n&\\underline{\\phantom{00}}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 136\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 81+55 in base-9 is $\\boxed{136}$.

To add 54 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 6. Since 4+6=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9, so we carry over to the next digit, which is 10 in base-9. \n\n10 in base-9 is represented as "11", so we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 5 (since we carried over 1 from the units digit). 5+5=10 in base-10, so we carry over to the next digit. \n\nAgain, in base-9, we carry over to the next digit, which is 10 in base-9. We represent 10 in base-9 as "11", so we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0 (since we carried over 1 from the tens digit). 0+0=0, so we write down 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 54\n+56\n---\n110\n\nIn base-9, 110 is equivalent to 121 in base-10.

To add 17 and 46 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a 1 to the next digit. Therefore, the units digit of our answer is 4, and we carry-over a 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 1 and 4 (the carried-over digit from the units place). 1+4=5, so the tens digit of our answer is 5. \n\nTherefore, 17+46=54 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{54}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 8. This gives us 16, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe digit 16 in base-9 is equivalent to 17 in base-10. To convert this back to base-9, we divide 17 by 9 and get a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 8. So the rightmost digit of our sum is 8, and we carry over the 1 to the next digit.\n\nNow we add the next digits, which are 6 and 8 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 15, which is also greater than 8, so we need to carry over again. \n\nThe digit 15 in base-9 is equivalent to 16 in base-10, which is equivalent to 1*9 + 7. So the second digit of our sum is 7, and we carry over the 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 1, which is less than 9, so we don't need to carry over.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 68\n+88\n---\n156\n\nBut remember, we're in base-9, so the digits we can use are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. We need to convert 156 to base-9 by dividing by 9 and taking remainders:\n\n156 = 17*9 + 3\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{73}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 10 in base-9, but since we can only use digits 0-8, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe next digits to the left are both 8, so we add those along with the carried-over 1, giving us 17 in base-9. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe leftmost digits are both 0, but we need to add the carried-over 1.

In base-9, 7+4=12, but we can't write down 12 as a single digit in base-9. Instead, we write down 12-9=3 as the tens digit of the sum, and we carry-over 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the hundreds digits, which are both 0.

This gives us a total of 14, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the digit 6 (which represents 14-9) in the units place and carry over the digit 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are both 3, and we add the carried-over digit of 1.

To add 40 and 68 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 8, but we need to carry over to the next column since 8 is the ninth digit in base-9. So we write down 8 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 4 and 6, and add the carried over 1. This gives us 11, which is the equivalent of 12 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to write down 2 and carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0, and add the carried over 1.

In 17, the tens digit is 1, and in 81, the tens digit is 8. Adding these two digits gives us 9, which is the largest digit in base-9.

To add 54 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 2. In base-9, 4+2=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of our result. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we can think of this as the "tens" place. We add the digits in this place, which are 5 and 6, and we also need to add any "carry" from the previous step. In this case, there is no carry, so we simply add 5+6=11. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot write down the digit 11. Instead, we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place. Specifically, we can think of 11 as 1 nine and 2 ones. So we write down the digit 2 in the nines place of our result, and we carry the digit 1 over to the next place.\n\nFinally, we move on to the next digit, which represents the nines squared place (or the "hundreds" place in base-10). We add the digits in this place, which are 1 (the carry from the previous step) and 0.

This gives us 8. \n\nTherefore, 36+46=82 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{82}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 85 and 64 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 4. Since 5+4=11 in base-9, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 8 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. We get 8+6+1=15 in base-9. We write down 6 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just 1. We add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1, to get 2. \n\nTherefore, 85+64=162 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{162}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 85+42? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 42 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 2. In base-9, 5+2=7, which we can write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the tens place. In 85, the digit in the tens place is 8, which is equivalent to 1*9 in base-10. In 42, the digit in the tens place is 4, which is equivalent to 4*1 in base-10. So, we have 1*9 + 4*1 = 13 in base-10. \n\nWe need to convert 13 to base-9. The largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 13 is 9^1, which goes into 13 once with a remainder of 4. So, we write "4" in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, 85+42 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{124}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 82+63? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 82 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 8 and 6, and also include any carry-over from the previous step. In this case, there is no carry-over, so we simply add 8+6=14. However, since we are in base-9, we need to write 14 as a two-digit number using only the digits 0-8. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 14, which gives us 5, and carrying-over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the next digit, which is the 81's digit. We add 1 to the 8, which gives us 9. However, since we are in base-9, we need to write 9 as a one-digit number using only the digits 0-8. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 9, which gives us 0, and carrying-over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we have our final answer: \n\n82+63=150 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{150}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 82+28? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 82 and 28 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 8. In base-9, 2+8=10, but since we only have one digit to work with, we carry over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 2 (plus the carried-over 1). In base-9, 8+2+1=11, but again we only have one digit to work with, so we carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0 (plus the carried-over 1). In base-9, 0+0+1=1.\n\nTherefore, 82+28=111 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 85+31? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. In base-9, 5+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we can think of this as the "tens" place, since each digit represents a power of 9 instead of a power of 10. We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 3, and we also need to add any "carry" from the previous step. In this case, there is no carry, so we simply add 8+3=11. \n\nHowever, we are working in base-9, so we need to "regroup" this result. Since 11 is greater than 9, we can think of it as 1 group of 9 and 2 leftover units. So we write down the digit 2 in the nines place of the sum, and we carry the 1 over to the next digit to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place to the left, which is the nines squared place (or the "hundreds" place in base-10). There is no carry from the previous step, so we simply add 0+0=0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 85\n+31\n---\n 16\n  2\n  0\n---\n\\boxed{201}\n\nTherefore, 85+31=201 in base-9.

To add 62 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 5. In base-9, 2+5=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the nines place. We add the digits in this place, which are 6 and 5, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 6+5=12, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place. The digit "12" in base-9 is equivalent to the digit "13" in base-10, so we write down "4" in the nines place (since 13-9=4), and we carry-over the digit "1" to the next place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place, which is the nines-squared place. We add the carry-over digit from the previous step (which is 1), and the digit in this place, which is 0 for both numbers. In base-9, 1+0=1, so we write down "1" in the nines-squared place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  62\n+55\n---\n 117\n\nTherefore, 62+55=117 in base-9, which we write as $\\boxed{117}$.

To add 21 and 75 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 5. In base-9, 1+5=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we have a digit for 9, which is represented by the digit 8. Adding the digits in the nines place, we have 2+7=9. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down the digit 0 in the nines place of the sum, and carry over the digit 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digit we carried over to the next place value, which is the nines squared place. In this case, there is no digit to add, so we simply write down the carried over digit, which is 1, in the nines squared place of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  21\n+ 75\n----\n 100\n\nTherefore, 21+75 in base-9 is \\boxed{100}.

Since 6+6=12, we have to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, 12-9=3, and we add 1 to the next place value. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 64 and 60 in base-9 is 124. \n\n\\boxed{124}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 6+7=13, we write down the digit 4 (which is 13 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 8, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 2+8+1=11, which we write down as the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1.

Instead, we write down 1 in the tens place of the sum, and carry over the remaining 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the hundreds digit, which is 0. In base-9, 1+0=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  31\n+ 71\n----\n 102\n\nTherefore, 31+71=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 6+4+1=12, but again we write down 3 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. \n\nTherefore, 65+45=111 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 64 and 41 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 1. In base-9, 4+1=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of our result. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents the 9's place. In 64, there are 6 nines, and in 41, there are 4 nines. So we have a total of 6+4=10 nines. However, in base-9, we can only have digits from 0 to 8, so we need to "carry over" one of these nines to the next digit. \n\nTherefore, we write down the digit 1 (representing one nine) as the next digit of our result. \n\nFinally, we add up the hundreds digits, which are both 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{105}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 78 and 66 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 6. \n\n8 + 6 = 14 \n\nSince 14 is greater than 9, we need to carry over to the next digit. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 14, which gives us 5, and carrying over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 7 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step: \n\n7 + 6 + 1 = 14 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we subtract 9 from 14 to get 5, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step: \n\n0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \n\nTherefore, 78 + 66 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{150}.

To add 46 and 13 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 3. Since 6+3=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum. So we have:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 13\n----\n  59\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 4 and 1, and add the carried over digit, which is 1.

To add 37 and 42 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 2. In base-9, 7+2=10, but since we only have digits up to 8, we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 4, and we add the carried-over 1.

To add 83 and 72 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 2. In base-9, 3+2=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In 83, the digit in the nines place is 8, and in 72, the digit in the nines place is 7. We add these two digits, along with any carry-over from the previous step. Since there is no carry-over from the units digit step, we simply add 8+7=15. \n\nHowever, in base-9, we can only use digits 0-8, so we need to "carry-over" the extra 1 to the next digit to the left. Therefore, we write down the digit 6 (which is 15-9) as the nines digit of the sum, and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit (which is 1) to the next digit to the left, which is the nines-squared place. In this case, both numbers have a digit of 0 in the nines-squared place, so we simply write down the carry-over digit as the nines-squared digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 83 and 72 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{150}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We get 1+3+1=5 in base-9, so we write down 5 in the middle column.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0, and add any carried-over digits from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). We get 0+0+0=0 in base-9, so we write down 0 in the leftmost column.\n\nTherefore, 12+38=50 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{50}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 67 and 26 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n7+6 = 14 (carry-over 1)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 1 and 2, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get:\n\n1+2+1 = 4\n\nTherefore, 67+26 = 104 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 57 and 50 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 0. Since 7+0=7, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 5. Since 5+5=10, we have to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, 10-9=1, and we write down 1 as the digit in the 9s place. \n\nTherefore, 57+50=107 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{107}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 1. Since 0+1=1, we write down 1 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9's place, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down 6 as the digit in the 9's place, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which are 0 and 0 (since 81 has no digits in the 81's place in base-9). We add the carried-over 1 from the previous step, and get 1 as the digit in the 81's place of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 70+81=151 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{151}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 34 and 64 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 6. In base-9, 4+6=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 4, and add the carry-over digit of 1. In base-9, 3+4+1=8, so we write down 8 in the next place value.\n\nTherefore, the result of 34+64 in base-9 is \\boxed{82}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 37 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 0. Since 7+0=7, we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 3 in 37 and the 8 in 80. Since 3+8=11, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. We write down the remainder of 11 when divided by 9, which is 2, as the second digit from the right in the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit from the left, which is the 3 in 37. 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 37+80=107 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{107}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 2+0=2, we write down 2 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 7. Since 6+7=13, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0 (since neither number has a digit in the hundreds place). We don't need to carry over anything from this step. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n 62\n+70\n---\n132\n\nTherefore, 62+70 in base-9 is \\boxed{132}.

To add 78 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 8. This gives us 16, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit to the left. So we carry over 1 to the next digit, and add the remaining 6 to the next column. \n\nNow we have 7 + 8 + 1 = 16 in the second column. Again, this is greater than 8, so we carry over 1 to the next column and add the remaining 6 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we have 1 + 7 + 1 = 9 in the third column. This is equal to the largest digit in base-9, so we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the third column. \n\nIn the fourth column, we have 1. \n\nTherefore, 78 + 88 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{166}.

To add 36 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 2. This gives us 8 in base-9. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the 9's digit. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the 9's digits, which are 3 and 6. This gives us 9 in base-9, but since 9 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to "carry-over" to the next digit. \n\nSo we write down a 0 in the 9's digit and carry-over a 1 to the next digit, which is the 81's digit. We add the carry-over (which is 1) to the 81's digits, which are 0 and 6. This gives us 7 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 36+62 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{107}.

To add 40 and 75 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  40\n+ 75\n----\n```\n\nIn the ones place, we have 0+5=5. Since 5 is less than 9, we write down 5 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  40\n+ 75\n----\n   5\n```\n\nIn the nines place, we have 4+7=11. Since 11 is greater than or equal to 9, we need to carry over to the next place value. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 11, which gives us 2. We write down 2 in the nines place:\n\n```\n  40\n+ 75\n----\n  25\n```\n\nTherefore, 40+75 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{25}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 55 and 57 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 7. In base-9, 5+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nSo, we write down the digit for 2 (the remainder of 12 when divided by 9) and carry over the digit for 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 5 and 5 (the carried-over digit plus the digit in the next column). In base-9, 5+5=11, so we carry over the digit for 1 to the next column and write down the digit for 2. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit (1) to the leftmost column, which has a digit of 0 for both numbers. In base-9, 1+0+0=1. \n\nTherefore, 55+57=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 14 and 86 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 6. \n\n4 + 6 = 12 in base-9. \n\nSince 12 is greater than 9, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the current digit and adding 1 to the next digit. \n\nSo we subtract 9 from 12, which gives us 3, and add 1 to the next digit, which is 1. \n\nNow we move on to the next digits, which are 1 and 8. \n\n1 + 8 + 1 (from the carry-over) = 10 in base-9. \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nWe subtract 9 from 10, which gives us 1, and add 1 to the next digit, which is 9. \n\nFinally, we have 9 + 1 = 10 in base-9 for the leftmost digits. \n\nAgain, we need to carry over. \n\nWe subtract 9 from 10, which gives us 1, and add 1 to the next digit, which is 0. \n\nSo the final result is 1003 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{1003}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

So we write down 1 in the units place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 7 and 4, and add the carried over 1. In base-9, 7+4+1=12, but again we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down 3 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carried over 1.

Adding the carried-over 1, we get 7+2+1=10 in base-9. Since 10 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the digit 1 in the current column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next column, which are the carried-over 1 and the digit in the 81's place (which is 0 for both numbers).

To add 61 and 64 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 4. In base-9, 1+4=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents the 9's place. In 61, there are 6 nines, and in 64, there are 7 nines. Together, they make 13 nines, which is equivalent to 4 in base-9 (since 13 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 4).

There are no 9s in either number, so we simply carry over the 1 from the previous step. \n\nNow we add the digits in the 9s place, which are 6 and 5. In base-9, 6+5=11, but we carried over a 1 from the previous step, so we actually have 6+5+1=12. In base-9, 12 is written as "14", so we write down 4 as the digit in the 9s place of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place, which are 0 and 0 (since neither number has any digits in this place).

Since 6+6=12, we write down the units digit 2 and carry-over the tens digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 1 and 4 (since we carried-over a 1 from the previous step). 1+4=5, so we write down the tens digit 5. \n\nTherefore, 16+46=62 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{62}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 84 and 12 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 2. Since 4+2=6, we write down 6 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 84. We add 1 to it (since we carried over a digit from the previous step), and get 9. However, 9 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we write down 0 as the digit in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nMoving to the leftmost digit, we add 1 (from the carry-over) to the 1 in 12, and get 2. We write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 84+12=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 88+20? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 88 and 20 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. Since 8+0=8, we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in the tens place of 88 and the 2 in the tens place of 20. Since 8+2=10, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, 10-9=1, and we write down 1 as the digit in the tens place of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0. 0+0=0, so we write down 0 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n88\n+20\n---\n108\n\nTherefore, 88+20 in base-9 is \\boxed{108}.

To add 72 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 8. Since 2+8=10 in base-9, we write down 1 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 7+4+1=12 in base-9. We write down 3 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 0+0+1=1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 72+48=121 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{121}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 74+36? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 74 and 36 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 6. In base-9, 4+6=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 3, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step. In base-9, 7+3+1=11, but again, there is no digit for 11 in base-9, so we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step. In this case, there is no carry-over digit, so we simply write down 0 in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{array}{@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 1 & \\\\\n& 7 & 4 & \\\\\n+ & 3 & 6 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 2 & 2 & \\boxed{1} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\nTherefore, 74+36 in base-9 is equal to 221 with a carry-over of 1.

To add 15 and 78 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 8. Since 5+8=13, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the current digit and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  1\n 15\n+78\n---\n  4\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 7 (plus the carry-over of 1). We get:\n\n```\n  1\n 15\n+78\n---\n  44\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0 (plus the carry-over of 1). We get:\n\n```\n  1\n 15\n+78\n---\n  445\n```\n\nTherefore, 15+78=445 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{445}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 48 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 3. Since 8+3=11, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 4 and 6, and add the carried-over 1. We get 11 again, so we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just 1. We don't have any carried-over digits, so we just write down 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 1\\quad 2\\quad \\boxed{2}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, \\underline{\\quad\\quad 4\\quad 8}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, \\phantom{1}1\\quad 2\\quad 1\\\\\n&+\\underline{\\quad\\quad 6\\quad 3}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, \\phantom{1}1\\quad 2\\quad 2\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 48+63 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{122}.

To add 16 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 8. Since 6+8=14, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 14 is one more than the largest digit in base-9, which is 8). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the left, which are 1 and 8 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the next digit in each number). Since 1+8=9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the next digit in each number). Since 0+1=1, we write down the digit 1. \n\nTherefore, 16+88=105 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{105}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 13 and 67 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 7. Since 3+7=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n3+7=10, which becomes 1 in the units digit and we carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 3.

To add 41 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 5. In base-9, 1+5=6, which we write as "6" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. There are no 9s in either number, so we simply carry over the 1 from the previous step. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 9s place, which are 4 and 5, and add the carried-over 1. In base-9, 4+5+1=10, which we write as "11" in the 9s place. \n\nTherefore, 41+55 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{116}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 4+2=6, we write down 6 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. We add the carry from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits 6 and 3. Since 6+3=9, we write down 0 as the 9's digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry from the previous step (which is 1) to the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1. Since 0+1+1=2, we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 64+32=100 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{100}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

So, we have:\n\n4+6=10 (in base-9)\n10-9=1 (carry-over)\n1+7=8 (in base-9)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 7 and 1, and we get:\n\n7+1=8 (in base-9)\n\nTherefore, 74+16=88 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{88}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 46 and 72 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 72\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 6 and 2, which gives us 8. Since 8 is less than 9, we write down 8 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 72\n----\n   8\n```\n\nMoving to the next digit, we add 4, 7, and the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0), which gives us 11. However, 11 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "regroup" by subtracting 9 from 11 and carrying over 1 to the next digit. This gives us a digit of 2 in the tens place:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 72\n----\n  82\n```\n\nTherefore, 46+72 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{82}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 18+71? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 18 and 71 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  1\n 18\n+71\n---\n  9\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 1 and 7, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. We get:\n\n```\n  1\n 18\n+71\n---\n  9 1\n```\n\nTherefore, 18+71 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{91}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 53 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. In 53, the tens digit is 5, and in 51, the tens digit is 5 as well. So we have 5+5=10 in base-9. However, we cannot write down 10 as a two-digit number in base-9, since the highest digit is 8. Instead, we carry over the extra digit to the next place value, which is the hundreds digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over 1 from the tens digit means adding 1 to the sum of the hundreds digits. In this case, both numbers have 0 in the hundreds place, so we simply write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 53+51=104 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{104}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 28 and 78 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 8. \n\n8 + 8 = 16, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. So we write down 6 and carry over 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 2 and 7, and add the carried over 1: \n\n2 + 7 + 1 = 10, but again, we need to carry over the extra digit. So we write down 1 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over 1 to the digit in the hundreds place, which is 0: \n\n1 + 0 = 1. \n\nTherefore, 28 + 78 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{106}.

To add 62 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 1. In base-9, 2+1=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. There are no 9s in either number, so we simply carry over the 1 from the previous step. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third position, which represent 81s. Again, there are no 81s in either number, so we carry over the 1 from the previous step. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n 62\n+31\n---\n  3\n  1\n  1\n---\n 92\n\nTherefore, 62+31 in base-9 is \\boxed{92}.

To add 54 and 37 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 7. In base-9, 4+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 9's digits, which are 5 and 3. In base-9, 5+3+1=15, but again, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place (9x9), so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 81's digits, which are 0 and 0. In base-9, 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 54+37=112 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{112}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 53 and 41 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 1. In base-9, 3+1=4, so we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the 9's digit. In 53, there are 5 nines, and in 41, there are 4 nines. Together, they make 9 nines, which is one more than the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we need to "carry over" one nine to the next digit. \n\nIn base-9, carrying over one nine to the next digit is the same as adding 1 to the next digit. So we add 1 to the sum of the next digits, which are the 81's digits. In 53, there are 5 eighty-ones, and in 41, there are 4 eighty-ones. Together, they make 9 eighty-ones, plus the carried-over 1, which is 10 eighty-ones. \n\nHowever, 10 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over one eighty-one to the next digit. Again, this is the same as adding 1 to the next digit. In the next digit, which is the 729's digit, there are no nines to carry over, but we need to add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. In 53, there are 4 seven-hundred-twenty-nines, and in 41, there are 4 seven-hundred-twenty-nines. Together, they make 8 seven-hundred-twenty-nines, plus the carried-over 1, which is 9 seven-hundred-twenty-nines. \n\nFinally, we have added all the digits and obtained the sum of 94 in base-9.

To add 83 and 66 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. In base-9, 3+6=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the units digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 8+6+1=15, but since there is no digit for 15 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 6 as the tens digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n83+66=150_{9}=\\boxed{150}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 85 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. In base-9, 5+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we can think of this as the "tens" place, since each digit represents a power of 9 instead of a power of 10. We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 3, and we also need to add any "carry" from the previous step. In this case, there is no carry, so we simply add 8+3=11. \n\nHowever, we are working in base-9, so we need to "regroup" this result. Since 11 is greater than 9, we can think of it as 1 group of 9 and 2 leftover units. So we write down the digit 2 in the nines place of the sum, and we carry the 1 over to the next digit to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place to the left, which is the nines squared place (or the "hundreds" place in base-10). There is no carry from the previous step, so we simply add 0+0=0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 85\n+31\n---\n 16\n  2\n  0\n---\n\\boxed{201}\n\nTherefore, 85+31=201 in base-9.

Again, we write the result as 5 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just 1, and add the carry-over from the previous step. \n\n1 + 1 = 2 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 86 + 85 = 201 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{201}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 27 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over happens when the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 9. So we write down the digit 4 in the units place, and carry-over the digit 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 2 and 5, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 2+5+1=8. So we write down the digit 8 in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, 27+56=84 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{84}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 42 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 0. This gives us 2, but we need to carry over to the next column since 2+8=10 in base-9. The carry-over value is 1, so we write down 2 and carry-over 1. \n\nMoving to the next column, we add the carry-over value of 1 to the next digit of 4. This gives us 5. We then add the next digit of 8 to get 13, which is equivalent to 4 in base-9 (since 13-9=4). \n\nTherefore, 42+80 in base-9 is equal to 124 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{124}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 47 and 54 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 4. \n\n7 + 4 = 11 \n\nSince we are in base-9, we need to regroup the 11 as 1 ten and 2 ones. We write down the 2 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 4 and 5, and we add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. \n\n4 + 5 + 1 = 10 \n\nAgain, we regroup the 10 as 1 hundred and 1 ten. We write down the 1 ten and carry over the 1 hundred to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over hundred). \n\n0 + 1 = 1 \n\nTherefore, 47 + 54 = 101 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{101}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 8+7=15, we write down the digit 6 (which is 15 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 6 (the carried-over digit plus the tens digit). Since 6+6=12, we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are the carried-over digit 1 and the hundreds digit 0.

Therefore, we write down 4 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place.\n\nNext, we add the 9s place, which is 1+2+1 (the carried-over 1 from the units place). This gives us 4. We write down 4 in the 9s place.\n\nTherefore, 18+26=44 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{44}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 87 and 70 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  87\n+ 70\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 7+0=7 in the ones place. In base-9, 7 is represented as itself, so we write down 7 in the ones place and carry over to the next place value:\n\n```\n  87\n+ 70\n----\n   7\n```\n\nMoving to the next place value, we have 8+7=15. However, in base-9 we only have digits up to 8, so we need to carry over again. 15 in base-10 is equivalent to 16 in base-9 (since 1*9 + 6 = 15). So we write down 6 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  87\n+ 70\n----\n  67\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carried over 1 to the hundreds place, giving us:\n\n```\n  87\n+ 70\n----\n 157\n```\n\nTherefore, 87+70 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{157}$.

To add 58 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 6. Since 8+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  58\n +56\n----\n 114\n```\n\nIn base-9, this means:\n\n```\n  58\n +56\n----\n 114\n----\n```\n\nTherefore, 58+56=114 in base-9, and the final answer is $\\boxed{114}$.

To add 58 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n8+1 = 9, which becomes 0 in the units place and we carry over a 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 5 (the digit 8 was carried over from the previous step). 5+5=10, so we carry over a digit again:\n\n5+5+1 = 11, which becomes 2 in the tens place and we carry over a 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 1 (the digit 1 was carried over from the previous step). 1+1+1=3.

To add 80 and 55 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n```\n\nIn the ones place, we have 0 + 5 = 5. Since 5 is less than 9, we write down 5 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n   5\n```\n\nIn the nines place, we have 8 + 5 = 13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-9 since the digits only go up to 8. Instead, we need to "carry" the extra 1 to the next place value. This means that we write down 4 in the nines place (since 13 - 9 = 4), and carry the 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n  45\n```\n\nIn the eighty-ones place, we have 1 + 0 = 1. Since 1 is less than 9, we write down 1 in the eighty-ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 55\n----\n 145\n```\n\nTherefore, 80 + 55 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{145}$.

To add 55 and 25 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 5. This gives us 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to 11 in base-10. Since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 5 and 2, and we add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 8 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 55+25 in base-9 is equal to 108. \n\n\\boxed{108}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 7+5=12, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 and 3 (the carried-over digit from the previous step and the tens digit of 17). Since 1+3=4, we write down the digit 4 in the next column.\n\nTherefore, 17+35=44 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{44}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 54 and 80 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  54\n+ 80\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 4 and 0, which gives us 4:\n\n```\n  54\n+ 80\n----\n   4\n```\n\nMoving left, we add 5 and 8, which gives us 13. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit (1) to the next place value:\n\n```\n  54\n+ 80\n----\n  14\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit (1) to the next place value, which gives us:\n\n```\n  54\n+ 80\n----\n  14\n  1\n```\n\nTherefore, 54+80 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{141}$.

To add 82 and 45 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 5. In base-9, 2+5=7, which we write as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. We add 8 and 4, and also add 1 from the carry-over from the previous step (since 2+5=7, which is greater than or equal to 9). In base-9, 8+4+1=13, which we write as the second digit from the right in our answer. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry-over" the extra digit to the next place value. In base-9, 13 is equivalent to 1 ten and 3 ones, so we write down the 3 as the digit in the 9's place, and carry-over the 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit (which is 1) to the leftmost digits, which are both 0's. In base-9, 1+0+0=1, which we write as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 82+45=130 in base-9, which we write as \\boxed{130}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 6+5=11, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 8+1=9, so we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 0+1=1, so we write down 1. \n\nTherefore, 86+15=102 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 10+84? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to add the units (or ones) place, which is 0+4=4. Since we are in base-9, we cannot write "4" in the units place, so we write "4 mod 9" which is equivalent to "4". \n\nNext, we move to the next place value, which is the nines (or tens) place. We add 1 (which is represented as "10" in base-9) to 8, which gives us 11. However, we cannot write "11" in the nines place, so we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 11 mod 9 in the nines place (which is equivalent to 2) and 4 in the units place. \n\nThus, 10+84 = \\boxed{24}.

In base-9, 2+1=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. There are no 9s in 42, so we can just write down the digit from 81, which is 8. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place, which represent 81s. Again, there are no 81s in 42, so we just write down the digit from 81, which is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{123} \n\nSo 42+81 in base-9 is 123.

Since 5+5=11 in base-9, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over from the previous step. Since there are no more digits to add, we write down the digit 1. \n\nTherefore, 56+51=121 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{121}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, this means that we write down the digit 2 (which is 11 in base-9) and carry over the digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 6 and 1 (the carried-over digit).

To add 47 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over happens when the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 9. So we write down the digit 4 in the units place, and carry-over the digit 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 4 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 4+1=5, so we write down the digit 5 in the nines place. \n\nTherefore, 47+16 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{55}$.

To add 60 and 41 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 1. Since 0+1=1, we write down 1 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the ninth place, which are both 6. Since 6+6=12, we have to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down 3 (12-9) as the digit in the ninth place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNow we add the digits in the 81st place, which are 0 and 4 (since 60=4*9^2 and 41=4*9^1+5*9^0). Adding 0 and 4 gives 4, and adding the carried-over 1 gives 5.

So we write down 5 and put 1 in the next column to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just 0, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. \n\n0 + 1 = 1. \n\nSo the final result is 150 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{150}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 82+76? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 82 and 76 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 6. In base-9, 2+6=8, which we can write as "8" in the units place of our answer. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the 9's place. In 82, there are 8 nines, and in 76, there are 7 nines. So we have 8+7=15 nines in total. However, 15 is not a digit in base-9, so we need to "carry over" one of the nines to the next place value. This leaves us with 6 nines in the 9's place and 1 nine carried over to the 81's place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place. In 82, there is 1 eight in the 81's place, and in 76, there is 1 seven in the 81's place (since we carried over a nine from the 9's place). So we have 1+1=2 eights in total. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n82\n+76\n---\n  8\n  6\n 12\n---\n150\n\nTherefore, 82+76 in base-9 is \\boxed{150}.

To add 61 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 2. In base-9, 1+2=3, so we write down 3 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits. We have 6+6=12 in base-9, but since there is no digit for "12" in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, 12 is equivalent to 1 ten and 3 units, so we write down the digit "3" as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over the "1" to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 1. Adding the carried-over "1" from the previous step, we get 1+1+1=3 in base-9. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 1\\,\\,\\, 6\\,\\,\\, 1\\\\\n&+\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, 1\\,\\,\\, 6\\,\\,\\, 2\\\\\n&\\underline{\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 3\\,\\,\\, 3\\,\\,\\, 3\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 61+62 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{333}.

So we write down 1 in the units place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 6, and add the carried over 1. In base-9, 5+6+1=12, but again we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down 3 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carried over 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 52+67=120 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{120}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 62 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, which we write as "5" in the units place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nine's place, which are 6 and 7. In base-9, 6+7=13, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down the remainder, which is 13-9=4, and carry over the quotient, which is 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which are the carried-over 1 and the 0's from both numbers. In base-9, 1+0+0=1. \n\nTherefore, 62+73 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{145}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 4+8=12, but since there is no digit "9" in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, 12 is equivalent to 13 (since 1*9 + 3*1 = 12), so we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (since there is no hundreds digit in 42) and 1 (the carry-over from the tens place). In base-9, 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{131}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 10 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we cannot write the digit "10". Instead, we write it as "11" with a carry-over of 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the hundreds place, which gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 40+62 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{113}.

To add 16 and 53 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 3. Since 6+3=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  16\n+ 53\n----\n  11 (carry over 1)\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 1 and 5, and add the carried over digit from the previous step, which is 1. We get:\n\n```\n  16\n+ 53\n----\n 112\n```\n\nTherefore, 16+53 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{112}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 6, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. We add 7 and 4, and get 12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. 12 in base-9 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, so we carry over the 1 to the next digit. We write down the 3 as the next digit in our answer. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 0+1=1. We write down the 1 as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 70+46 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{103}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We write down the 3 units digit and carry-over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 8 and 7, and we add the carried-over 1. \n\n8 + 7 + 1 = 16 \n\nAgain, we regroup the 16 as 1 hundred and 7 tens. We write down the 7 tens digit and carry-over the 1 hundred to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 and 0, and we add the carried-over 1 hundred. \n\n0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \n\nTherefore, 87 + 76 = 163 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{163}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over digit to the sum of the 9's digits. The 9's digit of 35 is 3, and the 9's digit of 28 is 3 as well. Adding the carry-over digit 1, we get 3+3+1=7 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, 35+28=62 in base-9, which we can write as $\\boxed{62}$.

We add the 9's digits, which are 8 and 7, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 8+7=15, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. The digit 15 in base-9 is written as "16", so we write down 6 as the 9's digit of the sum, and we carry-over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next place value, which is the 81's digit.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 26+55? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 26 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 11 as 12 in base-9. Therefore, the units digit of the sum is 2 and we carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 2 and 5 (remembering to add the carried-over 1). 2+5+1=8 in base-9, so the tens digit of the sum is 8. \n\nTherefore, 26+55=83 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{83}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 66 and 85 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 5. \n\n6 + 5 = 11 in base-10, but since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-9, 11 is written as "12", so we write down the "2" and carry over the "1". \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 6 and 8, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step: \n\n6 + 8 + 1 = 15 in base-10, which is written as "16" in base-9. We write down the "6" and carry over the "1". \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0, and add the carried-over digit from the previous step: \n\n0 + 0 + 1 = 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 66 + 85 = 162 in base-9, which we write as $\\boxed{162}$.

Since 1+6=7, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 4 and 7. Since 4+7=11, we have to carry over 1 to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nFinally, we have no hundreds digits to add, so we can write down the final result: \n\n\\boxed{120}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 60 and 65 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 5. This gives us 5 in base-9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the ninth place, which are both 6. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 13 in base-9. However, we can't write 13 as a single digit in base-9, so we need to carry over again. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81st place, which are both 0. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 60+65 in base-9 is \\boxed{151}.

To add 78 and 21 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n8+1 = 9, which becomes 0 in the units digit and we carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 2, plus the carry-over of 1. This gives us:\n\n7+2+1 = 10, which becomes 1 in the tens digit and we carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next column, which is just the carry-over of 1. This gives us:\n\n1+1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, 78+21 in base-9 is \\boxed{102}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 43 and 68 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 8. In base-9, 3+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 9's digits, which are 4 and 6. In base-9, 4+6+1=11, but again, there is no digit for 11 in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 81's place (9x9), so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the sum of the 81's digits, which are 0 and 1. In base-9, 0+1+1=2, so the final result is:\n\n43+68=111_{9}\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{111_{9}}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 26 and 45 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-9, this means that we write down 2 (the remainder of 11 when divided by 9) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 2 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

Therefore, we write down 2 as the digit in the 9's place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place, which are 1 (the carry-over) and 0.

To add 56 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 8. Since 6+8=14, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So, we have:\n\n6+8 = 14\n14-9 = 5 (write down 5 as the units digit)\n1 (carry-over to the next place value)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 5 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n5+4+1 = 10\n10-9 = 1 (write down 1 as the tens digit)\n\nTherefore, 56+48 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{61}$.

Since 4+1=5, we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 2 and 7. Since 2+7=9, we have to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down the digit 0 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (from carrying over) and 1. Since 0+1=1, we write down the digit 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 24+71 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{105}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 8 and 6, and also include any carry-over from the previous step. In this case, there is no carry-over, so we simply add 8+6=14. However, since we are in base-9, we need to write 14 as a two-digit number using only the digits 0-8. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 14, which gives us 5, and carrying-over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the next digit, which is the 81's digit. We add 1 to the 8, which gives us 9. However, since we are in base-9, we need to write 9 as a one-digit number using only the digits 0-8. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 9, which gives us 0, and carrying-over the remaining 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we have our final answer: \n\n82+63=150 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{150}.

To add 17 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe digit 15 in base-10 is equivalent to 16 in base-9 (since there are no digits for 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 in base-9). So we write down the digit 6 (the "ones" digit of 16) and carry over the digit 1 (the "nines" digit of 16) to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 1. This gives us 2.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 8.\n\nTherefore, 17+88 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{206}.

We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 4 (since we carried over a 1 from the units place). In base-9, 8+4=12, which is equivalent to "13" in base-9 (since we can't use the digit "9"). We write the "3" in the 9's place and carry over the "1" to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place to the left, which is the 81's place. The digits in this place are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 0 (since there are no digits in the 81's place in either number).

Since 1+4=5, we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 7 and 7. Since 7+7=14, we have to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we subtract 9 from 14 to get 5, and add 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 71 and 74 in base-9 is 146. \n\n\\boxed{146}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 61 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. In base-9, 1+8=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as "01" and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 1 (the digit in the "tens" place). We also add the carried 1 from the previous column. In base-9, 6+1+1=8, so we write down 8 in the "tens" place.\n\nTherefore, 61+18=80 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{80}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 28 and 13 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 3. Since 8+3=11, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 2 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 2+1=3, so we write down 3 in the next column. \n\nTherefore, 28+13=31 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{31}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 74+21? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 74 and 21 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 1. Since 4+1=5 in base-9, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 2, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 7+2+1=10 in base-9. Since 10 is a two-digit number in base-9, we write down the digit 1 in this column and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit 1. We write down the digit 1 in this column. \n\nTherefore, 74+21=105 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{105}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 31 and 38 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 8. Since 1+8=9, we write down 0 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place, which are 3 and 3 (the carried-over 1 plus the digit in the tens place of 31, and the digit in the tens place of 38, respectively). 3+3+1=7, so we write down 7 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, 31+38=70 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{70}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 43 and 84 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. In base-9, 3+4=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. In 43, there are no 9s, so we can just carry over the 0 to the next step. In 84, there is one 9, so we add that to the next step. \n\nNow we are adding 4 (the digit in the 9s place of 43) and 1 (the carry-over from the 9s place of 84). In base-9, 4+1=5, which we write as "5" in the 9s place. \n\nTherefore, 43+84 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{52}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 73 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 8. Since 3+8=11 in base-10, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, this means that we write down a 2 (since 11 is one more than the largest digit, which is 8) and subtract 9 from the sum. So we have:\n\n 3\n+8\n---\n11\n\nIn base-9, this is:\n\n 3\n+8\n---\n12\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 7 and 1 (the digit we carried over). 7+1=8, so we write down an 8 in the next place value. So far, we have:\n\n 3\n+8\n---\n12\n 8\n\nFinally, we have no more digits to add, so we can write down the final result, which is:\n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 81+42? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 81 and 42 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 2. Since 1+2=3, we write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 8 and 4. Since 8+4=12, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we write down 3 (the units digit of 12) as the second digit from the right, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nAdding the next digits, we have 1, the carried-over digit, and 0. 1+0+1=2, so we write down 2 as the third digit from the right. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0. 0+0=0, so we write down 0 as the leftmost digit. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\boxed{123}\n\nTherefore, 81+42=123 in base-9.

To add 77 and 23 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 3. This gives us 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to the digit "1" with a carry-over of 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are both 7. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 15 in base-9, which is equivalent to the digit "6" with a carry-over of 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step to the digit in the hundreds place, which is 0. This gives us a total of 1 in base-9, which is equivalent to the digit "1". \n\nTherefore, 77+23 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{161}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 86 and 53 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 3. In base-9, 6+3=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 5, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 8+5+1=14, but again, there is no digit for 14 in base-9, so we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 5 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0, and add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-9, 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the result of 86+53 in base-9 is \\boxed{151}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 18+72? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to add the digits in the ones place, which are 8 and 2. Since 8+2=10, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nines place, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 7. This gives us 8. \n\nTherefore, 18+72= \\boxed{80}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 82+14? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 82 and 14 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 4. In base-9, 2+4=6, which we write as "6" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the 9's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 1, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 8+1=10, but we can't write "10" in base-9 because we only have digits 0-8. Instead, we write "10" as "11" (which means one group of 9 and one leftover). So, we write "11" in the 9's place. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 82 and 14 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{116}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 86 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 6. \n\n7 + 6 = 13, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. 13 in base-10 is equivalent to 14 in base-9, so we write down the digit 4 and carry over the digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are both 7. We also need to add the carried-over digit from the previous step. \n\n7 + 7 + 1 = 15, which is equivalent to 16 in base-9. We write down the digit 6 and carry over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0. We also need to add the carried-over digit from the previous step. \n\n0 + 0 + 1 = 1. \n\nTherefore, 77 + 86 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{146}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 68 and 41 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and 1. Since 8+1=9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 4, and add the carried-over 1. We get 6+4+1=11. Since 11 is greater than 9, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carried-over 1.

Since 8+5=13, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 5 and 4, and we add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 10, which we write as 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 0 and 1, and we add the carry-over digit of 1.

To add 56 and 65 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 11 as 12 in base-9. Therefore, the units digit of the sum is 2 and we carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 6 (the digits to the left of the units digits). We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. Therefore, we have 5+6+1=12 in base-10, which is equivalent to 13 in base-9.

To add 83 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 8. Since 3+8=11 in base-10, we need to carry-over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, this means that we write down the remainder of 11 divided by 9, which is 2, and carry-over the quotient, which is 1. So we have:\n\n```\n  83\n +58\n----\n  11 (carry-over)\n   2 (units digit)\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, along with the carry-over from the previous step.

To add 66 and 27 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 7. Since 6+7=13, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the remainder of 13 when divided by 9 (which is 4) and carry over the quotient (which is 1) to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 6 and 2 (the carried-over digit). We get 8, which is less than 9, so we write down 8 in the second place from the right. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit (1) to the leftmost digit (which is 0 in both numbers).

To add 81 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 1. In base-9, 1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 8 and 3. In base-9, 8+3=12, which is greater than 9. So we write down the rightmost digit of 12, which is 3, and carry-over the leftmost digit, which is 1. \n\nAdding the carried-over digit to the next digit from the left, we have 1+1+3=5.

To add 54 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 6. Since 4+6=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9, so we carry over to the next digit only when we reach 9. Therefore, we write down a 1 in the next digit and add the remaining 0 to the sum. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 5 and 1, and the 1 we carried over.

So we have 7+1+1=9. Since 9 is the largest digit in base-9, we need to carry-over again. We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the 10s digits, which are 0 and 1, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 66 and 38 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 8. Since 6+8=14, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the remainder of 14 divided by 9 (which is 5) and carry over the quotient (which is 1) to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 6 and 3 (the carried-over digit). 6+3=9, which is equal to the base, so we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place from the right, which are 0 and 3 (the carried-over digit). 0+3=3, so we write down 3. \n\nTherefore, 66+38=103 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{103}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 57 and 41 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 1. In base-9, 7+1=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as "A". \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 4. In base-9, 5+4=8. \n\nTherefore, 57+41=68 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{68}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 52 and 43 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 4. In base-9, 5+4=12, but since we are working with only one digit, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-9, 12 is written as "13", so we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum and carry over 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 (since 52 has no hundreds digit) and 1 (the carry-over from the tens digit). In base-9, 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n52+43 = 95\n\nIn base-9, this is written as "\\boxed{95}".

To add 54 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 6. Since 4+6=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9, so we carry over to the next digit only when we reach 9. Therefore, we write down a 1 in the next digit and add the remaining 0 to the sum. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 5 and 1, and the 1 we carried over. This gives us 7. \n\nTherefore, 54+16=71 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{71}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 12 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 2. This gives us 4, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 82 and the 1 in 12. Adding these gives us 9, which is the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we write down 0 as the digit in the second position and carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 8 in 82. This gives us 9, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{100}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 18 and 75 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 5. Since 8+5=13, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 7 (the carried-over digit from the previous column plus the digit in the second column of 18). Since 1+7=8, we write down the digit 8 in the second column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0 (since there are no digits in this column for 75). We write down the digit 0 in the third column.\n\nTherefore, 18+75 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{408}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 25 and 17 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 7. In base-9, 5+7=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over digit to the sum of the 9's digits. The 9's digit of 25 is 2, and the 9's digit of 17 is 1, so we have 2+1+1 (the carry-over digit) = 4. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 25 and 17 in base-9 is 42. \n\n\\boxed{42}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 44 and 70 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 0. This gives us 4. We then move on to the next digit, which represents 9s. We add the 9s digits, which are 4 and 7, and we get 11. However, 11 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and we get 1. Putting it all together, we have:\n\n 44\n+70\n---\n114\n\nTherefore, 44+70 in base-9 is \\boxed{114}.

In base-9, 7+2=10, but since we only have one digit, we write down 1 and carry over the 0. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are both 7. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 7+7+0=14. Since 14 is two digits in base-9, we write down 5 and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 0+0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 77+82=150 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{150}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 48 and 75 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  48\n+ 75\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 8 and 5, which gives us 13. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next digit when we reach 9. In this case, we can write 13 as 4 with a carry-over of 1:\n\n```\n  48\n+ 75\n----\n   3\n```\n\nMoving on to the next digit, we add 1 (the carry-over) to 4, and then add 7. This gives us 12, which we can write as 3 with a carry-over of 1:\n\n```\n  48\n+ 75\n----\n  33\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the leftmost digit, which gives us:\n\n```\n  48\n+ 75\n----\n 106\n```\n\nTherefore, 48+75 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{106}$.

To add 80 and 85 in base-9, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 5. This gives us 5 in the ones place. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 80 and the 8 in 85. When we add these two digits, we get 16 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value. In base-9, 16 is equivalent to 17 (since there is no digit for 9). So we write down 7 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, we have a 0 in 80 and a 5 in 85, plus the 1 that we carried over from the previous step. This gives us 6 in the 81's place. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}8\\phantom{1}0\\\\\n+&\\phantom{0}8\\phantom{1}5\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&16\\phantom{0}\\boxed{5}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 80+85 in base-9 is \\boxed{165}.

To add 32 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, which we write as "5" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 3 and 7. In base-9, 3+7=10, but since we are using only one digit for each place value, we need to carry over the extra digit. So we write down "1" in the hundreds place (since 10 is one group of nine and one leftover), and write down "1" in the tens place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 and 0 (since we carried over the 1 from the tens place). In base-9, 0+0=0, so we write down "0" in the hundreds place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  32\n+ 73\n----\n 105\n\nTherefore, 32+73 in base-9 is \\boxed{105}.

To add 84 and 58 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) plus 8 plus 5. This gives us 14, which we write down as the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) plus 8. This gives us 10, which we write down as the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we have our final answer: \n\n84+58 = 131 in base-9 \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{131}.

To add 65 and 31 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. In base-9, 5+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of our result. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which represents the 9's place. In 65, the 9's digit is 6, and in 31, the 9's digit is 3. Adding these two digits gives us 9, which is the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we write down a 0 in the 9's place of our result, and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit (which is 1) to the hundreds digit of 65, which is 0.

Since 3+8=11, we write down 2 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 5, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 1+5+1=7, so we write down 7 in the second column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 13+58 in base-9 is equal to 72. \n\n\\boxed{72}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 44 and 18 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 3 (which is 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 4 and 1 (the carried-over digit). We get 5, so we write down the digit 5 in the second column from the right.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0 (since there is no carried-over digit). We get 0, so we write down the digit 0 in the third column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 44+18=53 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{53}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 64+72? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 64 and 72 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 2. In base-9, 4+2=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents 9s. In 64, there are no 9s, so we can just write down the digit from 72, which is 7. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since 4+2=6 and 6 is one more than 5, the largest digit in base-9). We add this carry-over to the digit in the next column to the left, which represents 81s. In this case, both numbers have a digit in this column of 0, so we just write down the carry-over as the digit in this column of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  64\n+72\n---\n 136\n\nSo 64+72 in base-9 is \\boxed{136}.

To add 84 and 10 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 0. Since 4+0=4, we write down 4 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the 9's place, which are 8 and 1 (since 10 is one more than 9). 8+1=9, but since we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. So we write down 0 as the digit in the 9's place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place (which is 9 times 9), which are the carried-over 1 and the 0 from the previous step. 1+0=1, so we write down 1 as the digit in the 81's place of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n84\n+10\n---\n  94\n\nSo 84+10 in base-9 is \\boxed{94}.

To add 25 and 73 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 3. In base-9, 5+3=8, which we write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the tens digits, which are 2 and 7. In base-9, 2+7=11, but we can't write "11" in the tens place because that would be a two-digit number. Instead, we write "2" in the tens place and carry-over the "1" to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over "1" to the hundreds digit, which is 0. In base-9, 1+0=1, which we write in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 25+73 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{103}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 56 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 2. This gives us 8 in base-9. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the nines digit. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the nines digit of 56, which is 5. This gives us 6. We then add the nines digit of 62, which is 6. This gives us 12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to regroup this as 3 nines and 3 ones. We write down the 3 ones and carry-over the 3 nines to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 3) to the next digit, which is the nines digit of 56. This gives us 6. We then add the nines digit of 62, which is 6. This gives us 12. Again, we regroup this as 3 nines and 3 ones. We write down the 3 ones and carry-over the 3 nines to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we have our final answer: \n\n\\boxed{132}.

To add 76 and 55 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. \n\n6 + 5 = 11 in base-9. \n\nSince 11 is greater than 9, we need to carry over to the next digit. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 11, which gives us 2, and then adding 1 to the next digit. \n\nSo, the next digit is 7 + 5 + 1 = 13 in base-9. \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we subtract 9 from 13, which gives us 4, and then add 1 to the next digit. \n\nTherefore, 76 + 55 = 131 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{131}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 83 and 44 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. In base-9, 3+4=7, which we write as "7" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the nines place. In base-9, we have to carry over to the nines place whenever the sum in the units place is 9 or greater. In this case, we have 8+4=12, which is greater than 9. So we carry over the extra 1 to the nines place, and write down the remainder, which is 3. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the next digit, which is the nines-squared place. We have 1+8+4=13, which is greater than 9. So we carry over the extra 1 to the next digit, and write down the remainder, which is 4. \n\nTherefore, 83+44 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{407}.

To add 32 and 83 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down the digit 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In 32, there are 3 nines, and in 83, there are 8 nines. In base-9, 3+8=12, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the digit 3 (the ones digit of 12) in the nines place of the sum, and carry over the digit 1 to the next digit to the left. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0. We add the carried-over digit 1 to the sum, giving us a final result of 116 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 32+83= \\boxed{116}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 57 and 71 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 1. This gives us 8 in base-9. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the nines digit. In base-9, we can think of this as the 9s place. We add the digits in the nines place, which are 5 and 7, and we also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 13 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to write this as 4 with a carry-over of 1. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digit, which is 0 in both numbers. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 1 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 57+71 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{148}.

To add 61 and 85 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 5. In base-9, 1+5=6, which we can write as "6" in the units place of our answer. \n\nNext, we need to add the digits in the 9's place. There is a 6 in the 9's place of 61, and an 8 in the 9's place of 85. In base-9, 6+8=14, which is greater than 9. So we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value. We can write the 4 in the 9's place of our answer, and carry over the 1 to the 81's place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81's place. There is a 1 in the 81's place of 61, and no digits in the 81's place of 85. So we can simply write the 1 in the 81's place of our answer.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  61\n+ 85\n----\n 146\n\nSo in base-9, 61+85=146, which we can write as \\boxed{146}.

We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 5. In base-9, 8+5=13. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value when we reach 9. So, we write down the digit "4" in the nines place, and carry over the digit "1" to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digit we carried over to the next place value, which is 1, to the sum of the hundreds digits, which are both 0.

To add 47 and 47 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are both 7. 7+7=14, but since we are in base-9, we need to regroup. 14 is equal to one group of 9 and 5 units. We write down the 5 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the 9s digits, which are both 4. We also add the carried 1 from the previous step. 4+4+1=9, so we write down a 0 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0.

In base-9, 7+8+1=16, but since we only have one digit, we write down 7 and carry-over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just the carried-over 1.

Since 0+1=1, we write down 1 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 3 and 8. Since 3+8=11, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit and write down the remainder, which is 2. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 0+1=1. \n\nTherefore, 30+81=111 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 75 and 31 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. Since 5+1=6 in base-9, we write down the digit 6 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 3, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 7+3+1=11 in base-9. Since 11 is greater than 8, we need to carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the digit 3 in the current column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the last column, which is just the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. \n\nTherefore, 75+31=106 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{106}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 6 and 4, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 11, which is equal to 1 hundred and 2 tens in base-9. We write down the 2 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which is just the carried-over 1.

This gives us 10 in base-9. However, we cannot write 10 in base-9 because the highest digit is 8.

To add 42 and 51 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 1.

However, since we are working in base-9, we need to write down the second digit of 12, which is 3, and carry over the first digit, which is 1.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (the carried-over 1) and 8. This gives us 9, which is the equivalent of 10 in base-10. Again, we need to write down the second digit of 10, which is 1, and carry over the first digit, which is 0.\n\nSince we have no more columns to add, we can write down the final result as \\boxed{118}.

To add 84 and 30 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 0. Since 4+0=4, the units digit of the sum is 4. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 3. Since 8+3=11, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which is just 1 (the carried-over digit). \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 84\n+30\n---\n114\n\nTherefore, 84+30 in base-9 is \\boxed{114}.

To add 75 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 6. In base-9, 5+6=11, but since there is no digit for 11 in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 9's place, so we need to add the carry-over of 1 to the 7 in 75. 1+7=8, so we write down 8 in the 9's place. \n\nTherefore, 75+56 in base-9 is equal to 131. \n\n\\boxed{131}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 83 and 24 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. Since 3+4=7, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is the 9's digit. We add the 9's digits, which are 8 and 2, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). 8+2=10, but since we are in base-9, we need to "carry-over" the extra digit to the next place value. So we write down 1 as the 9's digit of the sum, and we carry-over the extra digit (which is 1) to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next place value, which is the 81's digit. The carry-over digit is 1, and we add it to the 8 in the 81's place. 1+8=9, so we write down 0 as the 81's digit of the sum, and we carry-over the extra digit (which is 1) to the next place value. \n\nSince there are no more place values to add, we have our final answer: \n\n83+24=110_{9}=\\boxed{110}.

To add 12 and 80 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n  12\n+ 80\n----\n  \n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 2 and 0, which gives us 2. We then move to the next digit to the left and add 1 and 8, which gives us 0 with a carry of 1. We continue to the leftmost digit and add the carry of 1 to 1, which gives us 2. Therefore, the sum of 12 and 80 in base-9 is:\n\n  12\n+ 80\n----\n  102\n\nSo, 12+80 = \\boxed{102} in base-9.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 43 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-9, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 9's digit. We add the 9's digits, which are 8 and 4, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-9, 8+4=12, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. The digit 12 in base-9 is written as "14", so we write down 4 as the 9's digit of the sum, and we carry-over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over digit to the next place value, which is the 81's digit. In this case, there is only one carry-over digit, which is 1. We add 1 to the 81's digit of 0, and we get 1. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 82 and 43 in base-9 is:\n\n\\boxed{145}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 87 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 2. In base-9, 7+2=10, but since we only have one digit, we write 10 as "A". \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 6. In base-9, 8+6=14, but since we only have one digit, we write 14 as "E". \n\nTherefore, 87+62 in base-9 is "EA". \n\n\\boxed{EA}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 46 and 50 in base-9, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 50\n----\n```\n\nSince we are in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value whenever a digit reaches 9. Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 50\n----\n  16\n```\n\nThe digit in the ones place is 6, which is less than 9, so we write it down. In the next place value (nines), we have 4+5 = 9, which is equal to the base. Therefore, we carry over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  46\n+ 50\n----\n 116\n```\n\nThe final result is $\\boxed{116}$ in base-9.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 84 and 28 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 3 (which represents 12 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 8. This gives us 9, which we write down in that column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carried-over digit) and 2. This gives us 2, which we write down in that column. \n\nTherefore, 84+28=129 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{129}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 31 and 65 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 5. In base-9, 1+5=6, but we also need to check if there is a carry-over to the next digit. In this case, there is no carry-over, so we write down 6 as the units digit of the sum.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 6. In base-9, 3+6=12, but we can't write down 12 as a two-digit number in base-9. Instead, we write down the remainder when 12 is divided by 9, which is 3. We also have a carry-over of 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the hundreds place, which is 0+1=1.

To add 48 and 48 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are both 8. This gives us a sum of 16, which is greater than 9 in base-9. Therefore, we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying-over means subtracting 9 from the sum and writing down the remainder. So, we write down 7 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are both 4. We also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a sum of 9, which is equal to 1*9 + 0 in base-10. Therefore, we write down 0 in the tens place and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0. We also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a sum of 1, which is equal to 0*81 + 1*9 + 0 in base-10. Therefore, we write down 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  48\n+ 48\n----\n  107\n\nTherefore, 48+48 in base-9 is \\boxed{107}.

This gives us 10, which is equivalent to 1 nine and 1 unit. We write down the unit (which is 1) and carry-over the nine to the next digit.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 70+63? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 70 and 63 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3 in base-9. We then move on to the next digit, which is the 9's digit. Here, we have 7 and 6, which add up to 13. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. 13 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-9, so we write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the carried over 1 to the next digit, which is the 81's digit. Here, we have 1 and 0, which add up to 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 7\\,\\,\\, 0_{9}\\\\\n&+\\,\\,\\, 6\\,\\,\\, 3_{9}\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&\\quad\\, 1\\,\\,\\, 4\\,\\,\\, 3_{9}\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 70+63 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{143_9}$.

To add 83 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 8. In base-9, 3+8=12, but since there is no digit for 12 in base-9, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the units digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 3 (the digits we carried-over from the units place). In base-9, 8+3+1=12, so we write down 2 as the tens digit and carry-over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 (since there is no digit in the hundreds place for 83) and 1 (the digit we carried-over from the tens place). In base-9, 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the hundreds digit.\n\nTherefore, 83+88=171 in base-9, which we can write as \\boxed{171}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 65 and 16 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 6. Since 5+6=11, we write down 2 (the rightmost digit of 11) and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 5 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the digit in the second column of 65).

To add 40 and 87 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to 9, we need to regroup. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 7, which gives us 7-9=-2. We carry the -2 over to the next column (the nines column) and add it to the digits in that column. The digits in the nines column are 4 and 8, so we have -2+4+8=10. Since 10 is greater than or equal to 9, we need to regroup again. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 10, which gives us 10-9=1. We write down the 1 in the nines column and carry the remaining 1 over to the next column (the 81s column). The digits in the 81s column are both 0, so we simply add the carried 1 to get 1. Therefore, 40+87=127 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{127}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 43 and 65 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 5. In base-9, 3+5=8, which we write as "8" in the units place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents 9s. In 43, there are no 9s, so we can just carry over the 0 to the next step. In 65, there is one 9, which we need to add to the next step. \n\nSo now we need to add 4+6+1 (the carried over 9) in base-9. 4+6+1=11, but we can't write "11" in base-9 because that would require a digit greater than 8. Instead, we write "11" as "12" in base-9, carrying over the extra 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over 1 to the next digit to the left, which represents 81s. In this case, there are no 81s in either number, so we can just write the carried over 1 as "1" in the leftmost digit. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n43\n+65\n---\n108\n\nBut we need to write this in base-9, so we convert each digit to its base-9 equivalent:\n\n1 (carried over from previous step)\n0 (no 81s)\n8 (from adding the units digits)\n---\n\\boxed{18}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So, we have:\n\n7+8 = 15\n15-9 = 6 (write down 6 as the rightmost digit)\nCarry over 1 to the next digit\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the carried-over 1.

To add 36 and 24 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9 or 10, so we carry over to the next digit when we reach 8. Therefore, we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 2, and add the carry-over of 1.

In base-9, 7+7+1=15, but since we only have one digit, we write 15 as "G" and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just 1. \n\nTherefore, 72+78 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{AG1}.

Since 8+5=13, we have to carry over 1 to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 3 as the tens digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are 0 and 0 (since 81 and 56 have no hundreds).

To add 85 and 41 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. In base-9, 5+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 as the units digit of our sum. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which represents the nines place. In base-9, we can think of this as the "tens" place. We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 4, and we also need to add any "carry" from the previous step. Since we didn't have any carry from the units place, we just add 8 and 4 to get 12. \n\nHowever, in base-9 we can only use digits 0-8, so we need to "carry" the extra 1 to the next place value. Therefore, we write down the digit 3 in the nines place of our sum, and carry the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carry to the next digit to the left, which is the nines squared place (or "hundreds" place in base-10). There is no digit in this place for either of our numbers, so we just write down the carry as the digit in this place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n 85\n+41\n---\n126\n\nTherefore, 85+41=126 in base-9, and we can write our final answer as $\\boxed{126}$.

This gives us 6 in base-9, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 6 is equivalent to 10 in base-9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 7, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 14 in base-9, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 14 is equivalent to 20 in base-9.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 2.

This gives us 12, but since we are in base-9, we need to regroup. 12 in base-9 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, so we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are both 4, and we add the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us a total of 9, which is equivalent to 10 in base-10. We write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next column, which is just the carried-over digit of 1.

In 75, the tens digit is 7, and in 52, the tens digit is 5. When we add these two digits, we get 12 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we cannot write down the digit "12". Instead, we need to "carry over" the extra digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over works the same way as in base-10, except we carry over when we reach 9 instead of 10. \n\nSo, we write down the digit 3 (which is the value of 12 in base-9) as the tens digit of the sum, and we carry over the 1 to the hundreds digit. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits. In 75, the hundreds digit is 0, and in 52, the hundreds digit is 1 (because we carried over the 1 from the tens digit).

In base-9, this means that we subtract 9 from 11, which gives us 2. So the units digit of our sum is 2, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 3 and 7, plus the carry-over of 1. This gives us 11 in base-9, which we again need to carry-over. So we subtract 9 from 11, which gives us 2. The tens digit of our sum is 2, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the hundreds digit, which is 0. This gives us 1.

We write down the 4 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the 1 we carried to the hundreds digits, which are both 0. 1+0+0=1. \n\nTherefore, 67+67=134 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{134}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 75+81? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 75 and 81 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 1. This gives us 6, which we can write as "6" in base-9. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 8. This gives us 15, which is one more than the largest digit in base-9. Therefore, we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In base-9, this means adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n  7  5\n+ 8  1\n-----\n  1  6\n\nSince we carried over a digit from the tens place, we need to add it to the hundreds place. But there is no digit in the hundreds place, so we can just write it as "1" in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 75+81 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{161}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 67+78? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 67 and 78 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, we write down the digit 6 (which is 15 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 7 (the digit we carried-over from the previous step). 6+7=13, so we write down the digit 4 (which is 13 in base-9) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 1 (the digit we carried-over from the previous step) and 0. 1+0=1, so we write down the digit 1.\n\nTherefore, 67+78=144 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{144}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 60+88? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 60 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 8. Since 8 is larger than 0, we need to "carry over" to the next digit. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the current digit and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n  60\n+ 88\n----\n 168\n\nIn the second column from the right, we have 6 and 8, which add up to 14. We need to carry over again, so we subtract 9 from 14 (which gives us 5) and add 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n  60\n+ 88\n----\n 568\n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we have 1 and 0, which add up to 1. So the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{568}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
