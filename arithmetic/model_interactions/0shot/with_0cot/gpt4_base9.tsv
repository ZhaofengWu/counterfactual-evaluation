You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 76+14? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 6 + 4. Since 6 + 4 = 10, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column since we are in base-9. So, we write down a 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 1 + 1. Since 7 + 1 + 1 = 9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column since we are in base-9. So, we write down a 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 100 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{100}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 86+57? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the units place: 6 + 7. Since we are in base-9, we know that 9 is represented as 10.

To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 89 by 9 and find the quotient and remainder: 89 \xf7 9 = 9 with a remainder of 8.\n2. Divide the quotient (9) by 9 again: 9 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 9, we can stop dividing.\n\nNow, we can write the result in base-9 by using the remainders and the last quotient: 108.\n\nSo, 18 + 80 in base-9 is \\boxed{108}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 55+74? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 5 + 4. Since we are in base-9, we can directly add these numbers without carrying over: 5 + 4 = 9. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we carry over the 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 0.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 7 + 1. Adding these numbers, we get 5 + 7 = 12, and then 12 + 1 = 13. Since we are in base-9, we need to convert this number to base-9. To do this, we divide 13 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 4. So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist in this case).\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the base-9 number 140. Therefore, 55 + 74 in base-9 is \\boxed{140}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To do this, we can write 15 as 1 \xd7 9^1 + 6 \xd7 9^0, which is equal to 16 in base-9. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 9's place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 1 + 1. This gives us 5.\n\nPutting the results together, we get the final answer: \\boxed{56}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, 5 + 4 + 1 = 10, which is written as 10 in base-9. So, we write down a 1 in the tens place.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{100}.

Since 4 + 8 + 1 = 13, which is greater than the base, we need to carry over again. We can represent 13 in base-9 as 14 (1 in the ten's place and 4 in the unit's place). So, we write down a 4 and carry over a 1 to the next column, which is the hundred's place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add in the hundred's place, we simply write down the carry-over 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{140}.

So, 2 + 8 = 10 in base-9, which is equal to 1 in the next column (tens place) and 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place, including the carry-over: 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 in base-9. Since 14 is greater than 8, we need to carry over again. We can represent 14 as 1 in the next column (hundreds place) and 5 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the final result is 150 in base-9.

To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 89 by 9 and find the quotient and remainder: 89 \xf7 9 = 9 with a remainder of 8.\n2. Write down the remainder (8).\n3. Divide the quotient (9) by 9: 9 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n4. Write down the remainder (0).\n5.

We write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 5 + 1. In base-10, this is equal to 13, which is equal to 14 in base-9 (since 13 in base-10 is 1 group of 9 and 4 left over).\n\nSo, the final result is 146 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 7 + 4. Since 7 + 4 = 11, which is a two-digit number in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (tens place) and write down the 1 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place: 2 + 7 + 1 (the carry-over). Since 2 + 7 + 1 = 10, which is also a two-digit number in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (hundreds place) and write down the 0 in the tens place.\n\nFinally, we have a 1 in the hundreds place from the carry-over.

Since 6 + 3 + 1 = 10, we write down a 1 and carry over a 1 to the next column. However, since there are no more columns, we simply write down the 1 in the next place.\n\nSo, the result is 1 in the eighty-ones place, 1 in the nines place, and 0 in the units place.

In base-9, 15 is represented as 16 (1 in the 9's place and 6 in the 1's place).\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the 81's place, 6 in the 9's place, and 8 in the 1's place.

In base-9, 8 + 8 = 16, and 16 + 1 = 17, which is written as "17" in base-9. So, we write down the 7 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 172 in base-9.

Since 10 is one more than the base, we carry over a 1 to the next column (which would be the 81's place) and write down a 1 in the nines place.\n\nFinally, we have a carry-over of 1 in the 81's place.

So, we have a 7 in the units place and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 7 + 1. In base-9, 6 + 7 is 13, and 13 + 1 is 14. Since 14 is already in base-9 form, we don't need to make any adjustments.\n\nSo, the final result is 147. Therefore, 68 + 78 in base-9 is \\boxed{147}.

Since this also equals 9, we carry over 1 and write down 0 in the nines place.\n\nSince we have a carry-over of 1 left, we write down 1 in the next place (eighty-ones place).\n\nSo, the sum of 34 and 55 in base-9 is \\boxed{100}.

This gives us 7 + 1 + 1 = 9 in base-9. Since 9 is equal to 10 in base-9, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.

So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place: 6 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-9, 6 + 5 = 13, and 13 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (which is 8), we need to convert 14 to base-9. To do this, we divide 14 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 5. So, 14 in base-9 is 15.\n\nThus, the final result is 152 in base-9. So, the answer is \\boxed{152}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

This means we have a 1 in the nines place and carry over a 1 to the next column, which is the 81s place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over in the 81s place.\n\nSo, the final result is 1011 in base-9.

Since 9 is not a single digit in base-9, we carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, 36 + 58 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{104}.

To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 132 by 9 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   132 \xf7 9 = 14 (quotient) with a remainder of 6.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (14) by 9 and find the new quotient and remainder.\n   14 \xf7 9 = 1 (quotient) with a remainder of 5.\n\n3.

Since 3 + 4 = 7, we can write a 7 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 8 + 7. Since 8 + 7 = 15, we have a sum greater than 8, which means we need to carry over. In base-9, 15 is represented as 16 (since 1 * 9^1 + 6 * 9^0 = 15). So, we write a 6 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we simply write the carried-over 1 in the next place (the 81s place).\n\nSo, the final sum is 1 in the 81s place, 6 in the nines place, and 7 in the units place, which gives us the base-9 number: \\boxed{167}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 14+78? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's rewrite the numbers in base-9: 14 in base-9 is 1*9^1 + 4*9^0 = 9 + 4 = 13 (in base-10), and 78 in base-9 is 7*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 63 + 8 = 71 (in base-10).\n\nNow, let's add these base-10 numbers: 13 + 71 = 84.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-9: 84 = 9*9^1 + 3*9^0, so the result is \\boxed{93}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (ones place): 7 + 4. Since we are in base-9, we know that 7 + 4 = 11, which is equal to 10 + 1. So, we write down the 1 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 2 + 1 = 10. Since we are in base-9, 10 is equal to 11 in base-9. So, we write down the 11.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the result: \\boxed{111}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81s place) and write down the 0 in the nines place.\n\nSo, the final sum is 105 in base-9. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{105}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 1 + 2. Since we are in base-9, this addition is the same as in base-10. So, 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 6 + 4. Again, since we are in base-9, this addition is the same as in base-10. So, 6 + 4 = 10. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81s place) and write down the 0 in the nines place.\n\nSo, the final result is 103 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 7 + 2. In base-9, 7 + 2 = 10. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 6 + 1. In base-9, 5 + 6 = 13, and 13 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (which is 8), we need to carry over again. In base-9, 14 is represented as 15 (since 1 * 9^1 + 5 * 9^0 = 14). So, we write down a 5 and carry over a 1 to the next column, which is the hundreds place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add in the hundreds place, we simply write down the carry-over, which is 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 150 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 7 + 8. Since we are in base-9, we can only have digits from 0 to 8. So, 7 + 8 = 15 in base-10, which is equal to 16 in base-9 (since 1 * 9^1 + 6 * 9^0 = 9 + 6 = 15 in base-10). We write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 4 + 8 + 1. In base-10, this is equal to 13. To convert this to base-9, we divide 13 by 9, which gives us 1 as the quotient and 4 as the remainder. So, 13 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-9 (since 1 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0 = 9 + 4 = 13 in base-10).\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the final result: \\boxed{146}.

In base-9, 7 + 7 = 16, which means we have a 6 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 1 + 1. In base-9, 6 + 1 + 1 = 10, which means we have a 1 in the nines place and carry over a 1 to the next column, which is the 81s place.\n\nSo, the final result is 106 in base-9.

Since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81's place) and write down the 3 in the nines place.\n\nSo, the final result is 132 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{132}.

First, let's convert the numbers 70 and 60 to base-10 to make the addition easier. In base-9, the number 70 represents 7*9^1 = 63 in base-10. Similarly, the number 60 represents 6*9^1 = 54 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 63 + 54 = 117.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-9. To do this, we can divide 117 by 9 and find the remainder:\n\n117 \xf7 9 = 13 with a remainder of 0.\n\nNow, we need to divide the quotient (13) by 9 again:\n\n13 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, the result in base-9 is 140.\n\nTherefore, 70+60 in base-9 is \\boxed{140}.

Since 4 + 5 = 9, we have a carry-over situation because 9 is not a valid digit in base-9. So, we carry over 1 to the next place and write down 0 in the tens place of the result.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next place, which is the hundreds place. Since there are no other digits to add in this place, we simply write down 1 in the hundreds place of the result.\n\nSo, the result of 42 + 53 in base-9 is \\boxed{105}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (unit's place): 6 + 5. Since we are in base-9, we carry over when the sum is 9 or greater.\n\n6 + 5 = 11, which is greater than 9. So, we carry over 1 and write down 2 in the unit's place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (ten's place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 8 + 1.\n\n2 + 8 = 10, which is greater than 9. So, we carry over 1 and add it to the sum:\n\n10 + 1 = 11, which is still greater than 9. So, we carry over 1 again and write down 2 in the ten's place.\n\nSince we have another carry-over, we need to add another digit to the left.

We know that 9^2 = 81, which is too large, so we'll use the largest power of 9 less than 125, which is 9^1 = 9. We can fit 13 nines (since 14*9=126 which is greater than 125) in 125, so we have:\n\n125 = 13 * 9^1 + 8 * 9^0\n\nIn base-9, this is represented as 138.

To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 99 by 9 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   99 \xf7 9 = 11, remainder 0.\n\n2.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 7. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 + 1 = 10. So, 8 + 7 = 10 + 6 = 16. In base-9, this is represented as 17, since 1 * 9^1 + 7 * 9^0 = 9 + 7 = 16. We write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 9's place): 7 + 4 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 7 + 4 + 1 = 12. In base-9, this is represented as 13, since 1 * 9^1 + 3 * 9^0 = 9 + 3 = 12.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the final result: \\boxed{137}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (ten's place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 8 + 1. In base-9, 6 + 8 = 14, and 14 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 8, we need to carry over again. In base-9, 15 is represented as 21 (since 9 + 6 = 15). So, we write down the 1 and carry over the 2.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carry-over, which is 2.\n\nSo, the final result is 215 in base-9.

We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 4 + 1 = 11. Since 11 is 1 more than 10 in base-9, we write it as 12 in base-9.\n\nSo, the sum of 61 and 48 in base-9 is \\boxed{120}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 3 + 4 = 7, we can write a 7 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 6 + 4. Since 6 + 4 = 10, we have a carry-over because 10 is not a valid digit in base-9.

However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column and write down the other 1 in the result.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 8 + 1. In base-9, this addition is also straightforward: 6 + 8 + 1 = 15. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist yet) and write down the other 5 in the result.\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1 in a new leftmost column.\n\nSo, the result of 67 + 84 in base-9 is \\boxed{151}.

First, let's break down the numbers 13 and 37 in base-9.\n\n13 in base-9 means 1 * 9^1 + 3 * 9^0 = 9 + 3 = 12 in base-10.\n37 in base-9 means 3 * 9^1 + 7 * 9^0 = 27 + 7 = 34 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these base-10 numbers together:\n\n12 + 34 = 46 in base-10.\n\nNow, we need to convert 46 back to base-9:\n\n46 \xf7 9 = 5 with a remainder of 1. So, 46 in base-9 is 51.\n\nTherefore, 13 + 37 in base-9 is \\boxed{51}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 88+61? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 1 = 9. Since we are working in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we carry over the 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 8 + 6 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (which is 8), we need to convert 15 to base-9. To do this, we divide 15 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 6. So, we write down 6 in the nines place and carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81s place).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over of 1 in the 81s place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the result: \\boxed{160}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 52+73? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 2 + 3. Since 2 + 3 = 5, we can write down a 5 in the units place of the result.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place): 5 + 7. Since 5 + 7 = 12, we have a carry-over. In base-9, 12 is represented as 13 (1 nine and 3 units). So, we write down a 3 in the nines place of the result and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carried-over 1 in the next place (eighty-ones place).\n\nSo, the final result is 135 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{135}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are working in base-9, we need to convert 13 to base-9. \n\n13 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-9 (1 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry the 1 to the next column:\n\n  1 (carry)\n  64\n+70\n____\n  14\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n\\boxed{14}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (ones place): 7 + 4. Since we are in base-9, we can go up to 8 before carrying over. So, 7 + 4 = 11 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-9 (since 1 * 9^1 + 2 * 9^0 = 11 in base-10). We write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 4 + 1. In base-10, this is equal to 11, which is already a valid base-9 number (since it is less than 9^2 = 81).\n\nSo, the final result is 112 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{112}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place): 6 + 5 = 11. Since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81's place) and write down the remaining 2 in the nines place.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the 81's place, 2 in the nines place, and 2 in the units place. Therefore, 62 + 50 in base-9 is \\boxed{122}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 2. Since we are in base-9, we can directly add these numbers as 8 + 2 = 10. However, in base-9, 10 is represented as "11". So, we write down the "1" and carry over the other "1" to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the final result is 81. In base-9 notation, this is written as:\n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the digit in the 9^0 place is 0.\n\n14 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 5. So, the digit in the 9^1 place is 5.\n\n1 \xf7 9 = 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the digit in the 9^2 place is 1.\n\nPutting these digits together, we get the base-9 number 150.\n\nSo, 60 + 80 in base-9 is \\boxed{150}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place):\n\n6 + 3 = 9\n\nSince we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we carry over the 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over:\n\n6 + 3 + 1 = 10\n\nAgain, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 10. Instead, we carry over the 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist yet) and write down 0 in the nines place.\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1 in the new leftmost column (the 81s place).\n\nSo, 66 + 33 in base-9 is equal to:\n\n\\boxed{100}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 86+35? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the units place: 6 + 5. Since 6 + 5 = 11, which is a two-digit number in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place, along with the carry-over: 8 + 3 + 1. Since 8 + 3 + 1 = 12, which is also a two-digit number in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 again. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 in the next place.\n\nSo, the final result is 121 in base-9. Therefore, 86 + 35 = \\boxed{121}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 2 + 6. Since we are in base-9, we carry over when we reach 9. \n\n2 + 6 = 8, so there is no need to carry over. Write down the 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place): 5 + 6. \n\n5 + 6 = 11, which is greater than 9, so we need to carry over. To find the carry-over digit, divide 11 by 9: \n\n11 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, we carry over the 1 and write down the 2 in the nines place.\n\nNow, we have the digits 1, 2, and 8.

So, 4 is the rightmost digit.\n\n14 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 5. So, 5 is the next digit to the left.\n\nSince 1 is less than 9, it becomes the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the result in base-9 is 154.\n\nTherefore, 70 + 74 in base-9 is \\boxed{154}.

So, we write down a 6 in the units place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (the nines place): 6 + 3 = 11. Since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81s place) and write down the remaining 1 in the nines place of the result.\n\nFinally, we have a 1 in the 81s place from carrying over.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 6 + 3. Since we are in base-9, we can directly add these numbers without carrying over: 6 + 3 = 9. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we write 9 as 10 in base-9, so we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 5 + 1. Adding these numbers, we get 6 + 5 + 1 = 12. Since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 12. Instead, we write 12 as 13 in base-9, so we write down a 1 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over as the leftmost digit. So, the final result is 120 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, 66 + 53 in base-9 is \\boxed{120}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 5 + 8. Since we are in base-9, we know that 9 is represented as 10. So, 5 + 8 = 13 in base-9, which is equivalent to 14 in base-10. We write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 2 + 4 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-9, this is 2 + 4 + 1 = 7.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the final result: 74.\n\nSo, 25 + 48 in base-9 is \\boxed{74}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 2 + 5. Since 2 + 5 = 7, we can write a 7 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 6 + 3. Since 6 + 3 = 11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81's place) and write a 1 in the nines place of the sum.\n\nSo, the final result is 117 in base-9. Therefore, the sum is \\boxed{117}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n4 + 5 = 9\n\nSince we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. So, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over:\n\n6 + 5 + 1 (carry-over) = 12\n\nAgain, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 12. So, we carry over 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist yet) and write down 2 in the tens place.\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next column (hundreds place).\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n1 (hundreds place) 2 (tens place) 0 (units place)\n\nTherefore, 64 + 55 in base-9 is \\boxed{120}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 6 + 2. Since we are in base-9, we can directly add these numbers as 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (the nines place): 8 + 7. In base-10, this would be 15, but we need to convert it to base-9. To do this, we can divide 15 by 9 and find the remainder. 15 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 6. So, in base-9, 15 is represented as 16.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the final result: 86 + 72 = \\boxed{168}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

We write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the tens place: 1 + 1 (from the carry-over). This gives us 2.\n\nSo, the final result is 20 in base-9.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 35+17? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (ones place): 5 + 7. Since 5 + 7 = 12 in base-10, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (tens place) because 12 is greater than the base-9 maximum digit of 8. So, we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 1 + 1. Since 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 in base-10, we don't need to carry over any digits.\n\nSo, the final result is 52 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{52}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, 3 + 8 = 11 in base-9, which means we have a 1 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the final result is 81 in base-9.

We carry the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. Since 11 in base-9 is written as 10 + 1, we carry the 1 to the next column, which is the 81's place.\n\nSince there are no more digits in the original numbers, we just write down the carry-over in the 81's place, which is 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the 81's place, 1 in the 9's place, and 3 in the units place: \\boxed{113}.

So, we write down the "1" and carry-over the other "1" to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 5 + 1. Since 7 + 5 + 1 = 13, we have another carry-over. In base-9, 13 is represented as "14". So, we write down the "4" and carry-over the other "1" to the next column, which is a new column.\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over "1" in the new leftmost column (hundreds place).\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{141}.

So, we write down a 0 in the units place and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 8 + 2 + 1. Since 8 + 2 + 1 = 11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (which would be the 81s place) since we are in base-9 and 11 is not a valid digit.

Again, we cannot have a digit of 14 in base-9. To convert 14 to base-9, we divide 14 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 5. So, we write down a 5 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the next column (hundreds place).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add in the hundreds place, we simply write down the carry-over of 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 150 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 7 + 1 = 8. So, we write down 8 in the units place of the result.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 6 + 6 = 12. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81s place) and write down the 2 in the nines place of the result.\n\nSo, the final result is 128 in base-9.

So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 8 + 1. In base-9, 7 + 8 = 16, and 16 + 1 = 17. Since 17 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (which is 8), we need to carry over again. In base-9, 17 is represented as 20 (since 1 * 9^1 + 0 * 9^0 = 9 + 0 = 17 in base-10). So, we write down a 2 and carry over a 1 to the next column, which is the hundreds place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the final result is 120 in base-9.

In base-9, 2 + 6 = 10_9 (which means 1 carry-over and 0 in the nines place). Adding the carry-over, we get 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, the final result is 21_9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{21}.

So, 1 is the rightmost digit.\n\n16 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 7. So, 7 is the next digit to the left.\n\n1 \xf7 9 = 0 with a remainder of 1. So, 1 is the next digit to the left.\n\nPutting these digits together, we get the base-9 number 171.\n\nSo, 80 + 81 in base-9 is \\boxed{171}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 4 + 6 + 1 = 11. Since we are in base-9, 11 is equivalent to 12 in base-9. So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next place (eighty-ones place).\n\nSo, the final result is 126 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{126}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 2 + 7 = 9. However, since we are working in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9.

So, we carry over 1 to the next column (which is the hundreds place) and write down 0 in the tens place.\n\nNow, we only have the carry-over in the hundreds place:\n\n1 (carry-over)\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n100\n\nTherefore, 27 + 62 in base-9 is \\boxed{100}.

Since 3 + 4 = 7, we can write a 7 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place): 5 + 7. Since 5 + 7 = 12, we have a sum greater than 8, which means we need to carry over. In base-9, 12 is represented as 10 + 2, so we write a 2 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we can simply write the carried-over 1 in the next column (eighty-ones place).\n\nSo, the final sum is 127.

We write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the result is 50.

In base-9, 7 + 4 = 13, and 13 + 1 = 14. However, since we are in base-9, we need to convert 14 to base-9. To do this, we divide 14 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 5. So, 14 in base-9 is 15.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the final result: \\boxed{150}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 7. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 is the highest digit, so 8 + 7 will result in a carry-over. \n\n8 + 7 = 15 in base-10, but we need to convert this to base-9. To do this, we divide 15 by 9 and find the remainder. \n\n15 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 6. \n\nSo, 8 + 7 = 16 in base-9. We write down the 6 and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 9's place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 8 + 1.\n\n6 + 8 = 14 in base-10. Again, we need to convert this to base-9.\n\n14 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 5.\n\nSo, 6 + 8 + 1 = 15 in base-9.\n\nNow, we combine the results from both columns: 15 and 6.\n\nThus, 68 + 87 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{156}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 3. Since we are in base-9, we can't have a digit greater than 8. So, 8 + 3 = 11 in base-10, which is equal to 10 + 1. In base-9, 10 is represented as "11", so 8 + 3 = 11 in base-9. We write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 3 + 6. In base-10, this is equal to 1 + 3 + 6 = 10.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 6 + 3. Since we are in base-9, we can directly add these numbers as 6 + 3 = 9. However, since 9 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 3 + 7. In base-9, this addition is 1 + 3 + 7 = 11. Since 11 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (which is 8), we need to convert 11 to base-9. To do this, we divide 11 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 2. So, we write down 2 in the nines place and carry over 1 to the next column (which would be the 81s place).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 in the 81s place.

To do this, we'll find the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 131 and determine how many times it can fit into the number:\n\n9^2 = 81 is the largest power of 9 less than or equal to 131. \n\n131 \xf7 81 = 1 (remainder 50)\n\nNow, we'll move to the next lower power of 9, which is 9^1 = 9:\n\n50 \xf7 9 = 5 (remainder 5)\n\nFinally, we have 9^0 = 1:\n\n5 \xf7 1 = 5 (remainder 0)\n\nSo, the base-9 representation of 131 is 1 * 9^2 + 5 * 9^1 + 5 * 9^0, which is written as 155.\n\nTherefore, 75 + 70 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{155}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 8 + 4. Since 8 + 4 = 12 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column in base-9. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 8 + 1. Since 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column in base-9. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 142 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 7 + 3. Since we are in base-9, we carry over when the sum is 9 or greater.\n\n7 + 3 = 10, which is greater than 9. So, we carry over 1 and write down 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 6 + 1.\n\n7 + 6 = 13, and then 13 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is greater than 9, we need to carry over again. To do this, we divide 14 by 9 and get 1 as the quotient and 5 as the remainder.\n\nSo, we write down 5 in the tens place and carry over 1 to the next place (hundreds place). Since there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nThus, the sum of 77 and 63 in base-9 is 150.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{150}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 71+48? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 1 + 8. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 is the highest digit, so 1 + 8 = 10 in base-9. We write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 4 + 1 = 12 in base-9. Since 12 is greater than 8, we need to convert it to base-9. To do this, we divide 12 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 3.

To represent 15 in base-9, we write it as 16, since 1 * 9^1 + 6 * 9^0 = 15.\n\nSo, the sum of 67 and 82 in base-9 is \\boxed{16}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 4 + 1. Since 7 + 4 + 1 = 12, which is also a two-digit number in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist yet). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in a new column to the left.\n\nSo, the final result is 120 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 1 + 7. Since we are in base-9, we can go up to 8 before carrying over. So, 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 7 + 2. Since we are in base-9, we can go up to 8 before carrying over. So, 7 + 2 = 10 in base-9, which is equal to 1 in the next place (the 81s place) and 0 in the nines place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the 81s place, 0 in the nines place, and 8 in the units place. So, 71 + 27 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{108}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 8. In base-9, 8 + 8 = 16, but since we're in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column and write down the 6 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 9s place) along with the carry-over: 8 + 3 + 1. In base-9, 8 + 3 = 11, and 11 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is a two-digit number in base-9, we don't need to carry over any digits.\n\nSo, the final result is 126 in base-9.

So, we write down an 8 in the units place of our result.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column (the nines place): 3 + 8. In base-9, this addition is also straightforward: 3 + 8 = 11. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place (the 81s place) and write down the remaining 1 in the nines place of our result.\n\nSo, our final result is 1 in the 81s place, 1 in the nines place, and 8 in the units place, which gives us the base-9 number: 118.\n\nTherefore, 31 + 87 in base-9 is \\boxed{118}.

In this case, it is 9^2 = 81. However, since 81 is larger than 136, we move to the next smaller power of 9, which is 9^1 = 9.\n\nNow, we find how many times 9^1 (9) can fit into 136. We have 136 \xf7 9 = 15 with a remainder of 1. Since 15 is larger than the largest digit in base-9 (8), we need to break down 15 further.\n\n15 in base-9 means 1 * 9^1 + 5 * 9^0 = 9 + 5 = 14 in base-10.\n\nNow, we can express 136 in base-9 as 1 * 9^2 + 5 * 9^1 + 1 * 9^0 = 81 + 45 + 1 = 127 in base-10.\n\nSo, 70 + 81 in base-9 is equal to 151 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{151}.

Since 13 is greater than 8 (the highest digit in base-9), we need to carry over. To do this, we divide 13 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 4. So, we carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81s place) and write down the 4 in the nines place of the sum.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carried-over 1 in the 81s place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sum: 1 in the 81s place, 4 in the nines place, and 2 in the units place.

In the rightmost column, we have 0 + 8, which is 8 in base-9. So, we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 2 + 7, which is 9 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over. In base-9, 9 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 in the current column and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carried-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the result of 18 + 71 in base-9 is 108.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{108}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 8. In base-9, 8 + 8 is equal to 16, which we write as 17 in base-9 (since 1 * 9^1 + 7 * 9^0 = 16 in base-10). So, we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 7 + 1. In base-9, 2 + 7 is equal to 11, which we write as 12 in base-9 (since 1 * 9^1 + 2 * 9^0 = 11 in base-10).

Since 8 + 6 + 1 = 15, which is greater than the base, we need to carry over again. To find out how much to carry over, we divide 15 by the base (9) and get 1 as the quotient and 6 as the remainder. So, we write down a 6 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 160 in base-9.

To do this, we'll divide by 9 and find the remainders:\n\n113 \xf7 9 = 12 with a remainder of 5. So, the digit in the 9^0 place is 5.\n\nNow, we'll divide 12 by 9:\n\n12 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 3. So, the digit in the 9^1 place is 3.\n\nSince there is no remainder, we have found all the digits in base-9.\n\nSo, 75 + 50 in base-9 is equal to 35 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{35}.

To do this, we'll divide by the highest power of 9 that is less than 142:\n\n142 \xf7 9^1 = 142 \xf7 9 = 15 R 7\n\nSo, we have 15 in the 9^1 place and 7 in the 9^0 place. Now, we need to convert 15 into base-9:\n\n15 \xf7 9^1 = 15 \xf7 9 = 1 R 6\n\nSo, we have 1 in the 9^2 place and 6 in the 9^1 place.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 2. Since we are in base-9, we can go up to 8 before carrying over. So, 8 + 2 = 10 in base-9, which is equal to 11 in base-10. We write down the 1 and carry over the other 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 4 + 1.

Since 11 is greater than 8, we need to represent it in base-9. To do this, we divide 11 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 2. So, we write down 1 in the nines place and carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81s place).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over of 1 in the 81s place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the result: \\boxed{120}.

First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the addition easier. \n\nThe number 10 in base-9 is equal to 1 * 9^1 + 0 * 9^0 = 9 in base-10.\n\nThe number 84 in base-9 is equal to 8 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0 = 72 + 4 = 76 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in base-10: 9 + 76 = 85.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-9. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 85 by 9 and find the quotient and remainder: 85 \xf7 9 = 9 with a remainder of 4.\n2. Divide the quotient (9) by 9 again: 9 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 0.\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 9, we can stop dividing.\n\nSo, the result in base-9 is 104.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 4. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 is the highest digit, so 8 + 4 would be equivalent to 12 in base-9. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 7 + 1 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 9, but since we are in base-9, 9 is represented as 10. So, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the next place value.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carried-over 1 in the next place value (the 81s place).\n\nSo, the final result is 102 in base-9.

In base-9, this addition is also straightforward: 6 + 6 + 1 = 13. However, once again, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81s place) and write down the other 3 in the nines place.\n\nFinally, we have a 1 in the 81s place from the carry-over. So, our final result is 131 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 67 and 64 in base-9 is \\boxed{131}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 62+73? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 2 + 3. Since 2 + 3 = 5, we can write a 5 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 6 + 7. Since 6 + 7 = 13, we have a sum greater than 8, which means we need to carry over. In base-9, 13 is represented as 14 (since 1 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0 = 13). So, we write a 4 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we simply write the carried-over 1 in the 81s place of the sum.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the sum: 1 in the 81s place, 4 in the nines place, and 5 in the units place. So, 62 + 73 in base-9 is \\boxed{145}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 42+86? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 2 + 6. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 is the highest digit. So, 2 + 6 = 8. There is no need to carry over any digit.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 4 + 8. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 is the highest digit. So, when we add 4 + 8, we get 12. However, we need to represent this in base-9. To do this, we can think of 12 as 9 + 3. So, we can write 12 as 13 in base-9 (1 in the nines place and 3 in the units place).\n\nNow, let's combine our results from the two columns: 13 (from the leftmost column) and 8 (from the rightmost column). This gives us the final result of 138 in base-9.\n\nSo, 42 + 86 in base-9 is \\boxed{138}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we have:\n\n1 (carried over) + 0 (nothing in the 81s place for both numbers) = 1\n\nNow, let's put the digits together:\n\n1 (in the 81s place) and 6 (in the units place) gives us:\n\n\\boxed{16} in base-9.

Since 8 + 7 = 15, we need to carry over the value 1 to the next place, as 15 is greater than the base-9 maximum digit of 8. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carried over value of 1 in the next place.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the hundreds place, 5 in the tens place, and 5 in the units place.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 6 + 8. Since we are in base-9, we know that 9 is represented as 10. So, 6 + 8 = 14 in base-9. We write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 4 + 1 = 10 in base-9. We write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next place.\n\nSo, the final result is 104 in base-9.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 25+64? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n5 + 4 = 9. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 as the rightmost digit.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column, including the carry-over:\n\n2 + 6 + 1 (carry-over) = 11. Again, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 11. We need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 as the middle digit (11 in base-9 is represented as 12).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, our final result is:\n\n\\boxed{120}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 2 + 3 = 5, we can write a 5 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 8 + 6. Since 8 + 6 = 14, we have a sum greater than the base-9 system allows for a single digit. To handle this, we need to carry over the extra value to the next place value (the 81s place). In base-9, 14 is represented as 15 (since there is no digit for 9, we move to the next place value and add 1). So, we write a 1 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the extra 1 to the 81s place.\n\nFinally, we have the carried-over 1 in the 81s place. Since there are no other digits to add in this place value, we can simply write the 1 in the 81s place of the sum.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the sum: 1 in the 81s place, 5 in the nines place, and 5 in the units place. So, 82 + 63 in base-9 is \\boxed{155}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the digit in the 9^1 place is 1.\n\n10 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 1. So, the digit in the 9^2 place is 1.\n\nTherefore, 17 + 88 in base-9 is equal to 116 in base-9.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{116}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 2 + 4. In base-9, this is straightforward: 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 8 + 1. In base-9, this is also straightforward: 8 + 1 = 10. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value (the 81s place) and write down the 0 in the nines place.\n\nSo, the final result is 106 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n7 + 6 = 13\n\nSince we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit greater than 8. So, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (tens place) and write down the 3 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (tens place) along with the carry-over:\n\n7 + 8 + 1 (carry-over) = 16\n\nAgain, we cannot have a digit greater than 8 in base-9. So, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (hundreds place) and write down the 6 in the tens place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n1 (hundreds place) 6 (tens place) 3 (units place)\n\nTherefore, 77 + 86 in base-9 is \\boxed{163}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 1. Since 8 + 1 = 9, and we are working in base-9, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 4 + 1. Since 6 + 4 + 1 = 11, we write down 11 in base-9, which is 12.\n\nSo, the final result is 120 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{120}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 5 + 7 = 12, we have a sum greater than 8, which means we need to carry over. In base-9, 12 is represented as 10 + 2, so we write a 2 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we can simply write the carried-over 1 in the next column (eighty-ones place).\n\nSo, the final sum is 127.

In base-9, this would be:\n\n6 + 5 = 11 (in base-10)\n\nSince 11 in base-10 is equivalent to 12 in base-9 (1*9^1 + 2*9^0), we write down the 2 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 6 + 1. In base-9, this would be:\n\n5 + 6 + 1 = 12 (in base-10)\n\nSince 12 in base-10 is equivalent to 13 in base-9 (1*9^1 + 3*9^0), we write down the 3 and carry over the 1 to the next column.

So, we write down the 3 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 2 + 1. In base-9, this is equal to 9, which is 10 + 0. So, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 103 in base-9.

Since 2 + 3 = 5, we can write a 5 in the units place of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 3 + 7. Since 3 + 7 = 10, we have a carry-over. In base-9, 10 is represented as "11", so we write a 1 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write the carried-over 1 in the next place (the 81s place).\n\nSo, the final sum is 115. Therefore, 32 + 73 in base-9 is \\boxed{115}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place):\n\n0 + 4 = 4\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place):\n\n4 + 6 = 10\n\nSince we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81's place) and write down the 0 in the nines place:\n\n10 (base-9) = 1 (base-10) * 9^1 + 0 (base-10) * 9^0 = 9 (base-10)\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n1 (in the 81's place) 0 (in the nines place) 4 (in the units place)\n\nTherefore, 40 + 64 in base-9 is \\boxed{104}.

So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over.\n\nSo, the final result is 142 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{142}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (ones place): 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place): 6 + 3 = 9. Since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we carry over 1 to the next place value (the 81's place) and write down 0 in the nines place.\n\nSo, the final result is 106 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{106}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 11 is greater than 8, we need to represent it in base-9. To do this, we divide 11 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 2. So, we write down a 2 in the nines place and carry over a 1 to the next column (the 81s place).\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1 in the 81s place. So, the result is 120 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, 88 + 21 in base-9 is \\boxed{120}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-9, we need to carry over when the sum is equal to or greater than 9.\n\n8 + 5 = 13, which is greater than 9. So, we write down 4 (13 - 9) and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 4 + 5 + 1.\n\n4 + 5 + 1 = 10, which is greater than 9. So, we write down 1 (10 - 9) and carry over 1 to the next column, which is a new column in this case.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the new leftmost column.\n\nSo, the sum of 48 and 55 in base-9 is \\boxed{114}.

First, let's break down the numbers 15 and 74 in base-9.\n\n15 in base-9 means 1 * 9^1 + 5 * 9^0 = 9 + 5 = 14 in base-10.\n74 in base-9 means 7 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0 = 63 + 4 = 67 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these base-10 numbers: 14 + 67 = 81.\n\nNow, we need to convert 81 back to base-9. \n\n81 \xf7 9 = 9 with a remainder of 0, so we have a 0 in the 9^0 place.\n9 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 0, so we have a 1 in the 9^1 place.\n\nSo, 15 + 74 in base-9 is equal to 100 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{100}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 2. Since we are in base-9, we can carry over when the sum reaches 9. In this case, 8 + 2 = 10 in base-9, which is equal to 1 in the next column (the tens place) and 0 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the tens place: 8 + 7, and don't forget to add the 1 we carried over from the previous step. So, we have 8 + 7 + 1 = 16 in base-9. Since 16 is greater than 9, we need to carry over again. In base-9, 16 is equal to 1 in the next column (the hundreds place) and 7 in the tens place.\n\nSo, the final result is 170 in base-9. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{170}.

In base-9, 11 is equal to one 9 and two 1s. So, we can write a 1 in the nines place of the sum and carry over the 1 to the next column (the 81s place).\n\nFinally, we have a 1 in the 81s place from carrying over.

In base-9, 13 is represented as 14 (since 1 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0 = 13). So, we write down a 4 in the nines place of the result and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carried-over 1 in the next place (eighty-ones place).\n\nSo, the final result is 147.

To do this, we'll find the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to the sum:\n\n9^2 = 81 (too large)\n9^1 = 9 (just right)\n\nNow, we'll divide 72 by 9:\n\n72 \xf7 9 = 8\n\nSo, we have 8 sets of 9^1 in our sum.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 78+82? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 2. In base-9, this is simply 10, since there is no digit 9. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the nines place): 7 + 8 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-9, this is 16. However, since we are in base-9, we need to represent 16 in base-9 notation. To do this, we divide 16 by 9, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 7.

We write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the tens place: 4 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 10, which is 9 in base-10. Since 10 is represented as 11 in base-9, we write down the 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we have a carry-over of 1 in the hundreds place.

We know that 9^2 = 81 is too large, so we'll use 9^1 = 9:\n\n55 \xf7 9 = 6 with a remainder of 1\n\nSo, 55 in base-9 is 61.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 3 + 5. Since 3 + 5 = 8 in base-10, there is no need to carry over any digit in base-9. So, we write down 8 in the units place of the result.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (nines place): 7 + 2. Since 7 + 2 = 9 in base-10, this is equal to 10 in base-9. So, we write down 1 in the nines place of the result and carry over 1 to the next column (eighty-ones place).\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carried-over 1 in the eighty-ones place of the result.\n\nThus, 73 + 25 in base-9 is equal to 118 in base-9.
