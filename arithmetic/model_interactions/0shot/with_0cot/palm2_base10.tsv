Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	**Step 1:** We can add the digits of the two numbers together to get 4 + 8 + 2 + 3 = 17.\n\n**Step 2:** We can then carry the 1 from the tens place to the hundreds place, giving us 17 + 1 = 18.\n\n**Step 3:** Therefore, the sum of 48 and 23 is 18.\n\n**\\boxed{result} 18**	False	models/text-bison-001	None	None	None	0	1
