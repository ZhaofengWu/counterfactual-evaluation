To add A6 and 94 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A6\n+ 94\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are 6 and 4.

To add 6D and 66 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  6D\n+ 66\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are D and 6. In base-16, D represents the value 13 and 6 represents the value 6. Adding them gives us 19, which is represented as 13+6=19 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to represent 19 using a single digit. The largest single digit in base-16 is F, which represents the value 15. Therefore, we can write:\n\n```\n  6D\n+ 66\n----\n   F\n```\n\nNext, we need to add the next most significant digits, which are 1 (representing 16 in base-10) and 6. This gives us 17, which is represented as 11 in base-16 (since 16 is represented as 10 in base-16). Therefore, we can write:\n\n```\n  6D\n+ 66\n----\n  11F\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we have our final result.

Adding them together with the carry gives us 12, which we write under the line and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  9F\n+ 88\n---\n 1D2\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry from the previous step. The carry is 1, so we add 1 to the result:\n\n```\n  9F\n+ 88\n---\n1D2\n```\n\nTherefore, 9F+88 in base-16 is equal to $\\boxed{1D2}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add EA and 4A, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  EA\n+ 4A\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and A. In base-16, A+ A = 14 (since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10). We write down the result (4) and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  EA\n+ 4A\n----\n   4\n```\n\nNext, we add the next significant digits, which are E and 4, plus the carry-over from the previous step (1).

In base-16, 3+2=5, so we write down 5 as the least significant digit of the sum:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 7 2\n-----\n    5\n```\n\nNext, we move on to the next digit to the left, which is the 1's place. In base-16, A represents 10, so we need to add 10 and 7. In base-10, 10+7=17, but in base-16 we need to write this as 11 (since we only have one digit for each value from 0 to 15). So we write down 1 as the next digit of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 7 2\n-----\n  1 5\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 16's place. There are no digits in this place for 72, so we just add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-16, 1 is just 1, so we write that down as the most significant digit of the sum:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 7 2\n-----\n  1 5\n  -----\n  \\boxed{91}\n```\n\nTherefore, A3+72 in base-16 is equal to 91.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 86 and C1 in base-16, we first need to convert C1 to its decimal equivalent. \n\nC1 in base-16 is equal to 12*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 193 in base-10. \n\nNow we can add 86 and 193 in base-10: \n\n  86\n+193\n----\n 279\n\nSo the result in base-10 is 279. \n\nTo convert 279 back to base-16, we can repeatedly divide by 16 and write the remainders in reverse order. \n\n279 divided by 16 is 17 with a remainder of 7 (which is 7 in base-16). \n\n17 divided by 16 is 1 with a remainder of 1 (which is 1 in base-16). \n\n1 divided by 16 is 0 with a remainder of 1 (which is also 1 in base-16). \n\nSo the final result in base-16 is \\boxed{117}.

To add F0 and 9D in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  F 0\n+ 9 D\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are 0 and D. In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, so we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  F 0\n+ 9 D\n-----\n    D\n```\n\nNext, we add the next column, which consists of the digit 1 (carried-over from the previous step) and the digit 9. In base-16, 1+9=10, which is equivalent to A in base-16. So we write down A and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  F 0\n+ 9 D\n-----\n  1 D\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are F and 0 (plus the carried-over 1). In base-16, F+0+1=10, which is equivalent to A in base-16. So we write down A:\n\n```\n  F 0\n+ 9 D\n-----\nA 1 D\n```\n\nTherefore, F0+9D= \\boxed{A1D} in base-16.

To add BB and 78 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  BB\n+ 78\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are B and 8. B is equivalent to 11 in base-10, and 8 is equivalent to 8 in base-10.

Adding them gives us 18 in base-10, which is equivalent to 12 in base-16 (since 16 goes into 18 once with a remainder of 2, which is represented by the digit C in base-16). We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) and get 13.

To solve this problem, we need to understand what the number 3E+28 means in base-16. \n\nFirst, let's break down the number into its components: \n\n- 3 is the digit in the 16^1 (or 16) place\n- E is the digit in the 16^0 (or 1) place\n- +28 means we need to add 28 zeroes after the 3E \n\nNext, we need to convert the digits to their decimal equivalents: \n\n- 3 in base-16 is equivalent to 3 in base-10 \n- E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10 \n\nNow we can combine these values to get the decimal equivalent of the number: \n\n3E+28 = 3 * 16^1 + 14 * 16^0 + 0 * 16^2 + ... + 0 * 16^28\n      = 3 * 16^1 + 14 * 16^0\n      = 48 + 14\n      = 62 \n\nFinally, we need to convert this decimal value back into base-16: \n\n62 in base-10 is equivalent to 3E in base-16 \n\nTherefore, \n\n\\boxed{3E+28 = 3E00000000000000000000000000}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is C5+8F? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add C5 and 8F in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  C5\n+ 8F\n---\n```\n\nWe can then add the rightmost digits, which are 5 and F. In base-16, F represents the value 15, so 5 + F = 14 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to represent 14 as E:\n\n```\n  C5\n+ 8F\n---\n   E\n```\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1 in C5 and the 8 in 8F. 1 + 8 = 9, so we write down 9 in the next digit position:\n\n```\n  C5\n+ 8F\n---\n  9E\n```\n\nTherefore, C5+8F = \\boxed{9E}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is F0+F1? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	F0 is equivalent to 240 in base-10 (since F is the 15th digit and 0 is the 0th digit, and 15*16^1 + 0*16^0 = 240). F1 is equivalent to 241 in base-10 (since F is the 15th digit and 1 is the 1st digit, and 15*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 241). \n\nTo find the sum, we simply add 240 and 241 in base-10: \n\n240 + 241 = 481 \n\nNow we need to convert 481 back to base-16. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 16 and keeping track of the remainders. \n\n481 \xf7 16 = 30 remainder 1 \n\n30 \xf7 16 = 1 remainder 14 (which is E in base-16) \n\n1 \xf7 16 = 0 remainder 1 \n\nSo 481 in base-10 is equivalent to 1E1 in base-16. \n\nTherefore, F0 + F1 = \\boxed{1E1}.

To add 8A and 5E, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 5E\n----\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is E + A. In base-16, E represents 14 and A represents 10, so:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 5E\n----\n  C\n```\n\nThe next place value is the 16s place (one digit to the left). We add the 16s place digits (5 and 8), plus any carry from the previous step (which is 1, since 14 + 10 = 24, which is greater than 16):\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 5E\n----\n  C3\n```\n\nTherefore, 8A + 5E = C3 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{C3}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 1D and 42 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  1D\n+ 42\n----\n```\n\nThe units column gives us a sum of D+2, which is 13+2=15 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to write this as F (since F is the digit that represents 15 in base-16). We write down the F in the units column and carry-over the 1 to the sixteens column:\n\n```\n  1D\n+ 42\n----\n   F\n```\n\nIn the sixteens column, we have 1+1=2 (in base-10), which is represented as 2 in base-16. We write down the 2 in the sixteens column:\n\n```\n  1D\n+ 42\n----\n  2F\n```\n\nTherefore, 1D+42 = 2F in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{2F}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add E4 and 1C, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  E 4\n+ 1 C\n-----\n```\n\nWe can see that the least significant digit is 4+ C, which is 10 in base-10. However, in base-16, we represent 10 as A.

To add FF and BA in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ BA\n---\n```\n\nWe can then add the rightmost digits, which are A and F. In base-16, A represents 10, and F represents 15. Adding them gives us 1F:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ BA\n---\n  1F\n```\n\nWe then move on to the next digits to the left, which are F and B. Adding them gives us 14:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ BA\n---\n 14F\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0. Adding them gives us 1:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ BA\n---\n 14F\n```\n\nTherefore, FF+BA in base-16 is equal to $\\boxed{14F}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

D is the 13th digit in base-16, so it represents the number 13. Therefore, DD represents 13*16 + 13 = 221 in base-10.\n\nNext, we can add 42 and 221 in base-10: 42 + 221 = 263.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 263 back to base-16. 263 divided by 16 gives a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 7 (since 16*16 = 256 is too large). The remainder 7 corresponds to the digit 7 in base-16. The quotient 16 can be divided by 16 to give a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 0. The remainder 0 corresponds to the digit 0 in base-16.

We write down the 9 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 4A\n----\n  19\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right:\n\n```\n  1C\n+ 4A\n----\n```\n\n```\n  C\n+ A\n---\n  16\n```\n\nAgain, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add DD and B7, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ B7\n---\n```\n\nWe can then add the rightmost digits, which are D and 7. In base-16, D represents 13 and 7 represents 7, so:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ B7\n---\n  4A\n```\n\nThe result of adding D and 7 is 4A.

So:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ B7\n---\n  4A\n+ 1D\n---\n  67\n```\n\nThe result of adding D, B, and A is 1D. We write down the 7 and carry the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are the carried 1 and the remaining D:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ B7\n---\n  4A\n+ 1D\n---\n  67\n+ 1\n---\n  68\n```\n\nThe result of adding the carried 1 and D is 1E. We write down the 8 and carry the E (which represents 14) to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carried E:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ B7\n---\n  4A\n+ 1D\n---\n  68D\n```\n\nTherefore, DD+B7=68D. \n\n$$\\boxed{68D}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add AC and 97 in base-16, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ 97\n----\n```\n\nSince C + 7 = 13 in base-16, we write down 3 and carry-over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ 97\n----\n  13\n```\n\nNext, we add A + 9 + the carried-over 1:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ 97\n----\n  13\n+ 10\n----\n  23\n```\n\nSo AC + 97 = 23 in base-16.

To add 6E and FA, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  6E\n+ FA\n---\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is E + A.

To solve this problem, we need to convert the hexadecimal numbers 2C and B8 into decimal numbers, add them together, and then convert the result back into hexadecimal.\n\nFirst, let's convert 2C to decimal. The digit 2 is in the 16's place, and the digit C is in the 1's place. Using the formula for converting from hexadecimal to decimal, we have:\n\n2C = 2*16 + 12 = 44\n\nNext, let's convert B8 to decimal.

To add DF and 9A, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  DF\n+ 9A\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and F. In base-16, A + F = 19, which is 13 in base-10.

In base-16, 9 + E = 17, which is 23 in base-10 (remembering to add the carry-over from the previous step). In base-16, 23 is written as 17, so we write down 7 as the next digit of the result, and carry-over 1:\n\n```\n  DF\n+ 9A\n----\n  73\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are D and 0 (since we have no carry-over left).

To add AC and C6 in base-16, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ C6\n---\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is 12 in AC and 6 in C6. Adding these gives 18, which is greater than 15 (the largest digit in base-16), so we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down the remainder (which is 18 - 16 = 2) in the units place and carry over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ C6\n---\n  12\n```\n\nNow we add the digits in the next place value (the 16s place). There is a 1 in the AC number and a C in the C6 number. Converting C to base-10 gives us 12, so the sum is 1 + 12 = 13. We write down the remainder (which is 13 in base-10 or D in base-16) in the 16s place and carry over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ C6\n---\n  12\n+  1D\n----\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value (the 256s place). There is no digit in the AC number, so we treat it as 0. There is an implied 0 in the C6 number, since it only has two digits. Adding 0 and 0 gives us 0. We write down the remainder (which is 0 in base-10 or 0 in base-16) in the 256s place:\n\n```\n  AC\n+ C6\n---\n  12\n+  1D\n----\n  C8\n```\n\nTherefore, AC + C6 = C8 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{\\text{C8}}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

F in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, and 1 in base-16 is equivalent to 1 in base-10.

In base-16, C + 3 = F, since C is worth 12 and 3 is worth 3, and 12 + 3 = 15, which is represented by F. We write down the F in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  8C\n+ C3\n---\n  FF\n```\n\nThe next place value is the 16s place (one position to the left of the units place). We add the carried-over 1 to 8C and get 8D:\n\n```\n  8C\n+ C3\n---\n  FF\n+ 1D\n---\n```\n\nNow we have to add D (in the 16s place) to the remaining digits.

To add D7 and AB in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  D7\n+ AB\n---\n```\n\nWe can then add the rightmost digits, which are 7 and B. In base-16, B is equivalent to 11 in base-10, so we carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  D7\n+ AB\n---\n  12\n```\n\nNext, we add the middle digits, which are D and A. In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, and A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. Adding these together, we get 1D:\n\n```\n  D7\n+ AB\n---\n 1D2\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0. We don't need to carry over anything, so we simply add them:\n\n```\n  D7\n+ AB\n---\n 1D2\n```\n\nTherefore, D7+AB = 1D2 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{1D2}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 and therefore DD is equivalent to 13*16 + 13 = 221 in decimal.\n\nNext, we can add 55 and 221 in decimal: 55 + 221 = 276.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 276 back to base-16. 276 divided by 16 is 17 with a remainder of 4, so the rightmost digit is 4 (equivalent to "4" in base-16). 17 divided by 16 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so the next digit is 1 (equivalent to "1" in base-16). Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{114}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 2E and 4E, we first need to convert them to base-10:\n\n2E = 2(16^1) + 14(16^0) = 32 + 14 = 46\n4E = 4(16^1) + 14(16^0) = 64 + 14 = 78\n\nNow we can add them in base-10:\n\n46 + 78 = 124\n\nFinally, we convert the result back to base-16:\n\n124 = 7C\n\nTherefore, 2E+4E = \\boxed{7C}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add E3 and 45 in base-16, we first line up the digits:\n\n```\n  E 3\n+ 4 5\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are 3 and 5. In base-16, 3+5=8, which is represented by the digit 8:\n\n```\n  E 3\n+ 4 5\n-----\n    8\n```\n\nNext, we move on to the next digit, which is 1 in E3 and 4 in 45. In base-16, 1+4=5, which is represented by the digit 5:\n\n```\n  E 3\n+ 4 5\n-----\n  5 8\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are E and 0 (since there is no carry from the previous step). In base-16, E+0=E, so we simply write E:\n\n```\n  E 3\n+ 4 5\n-----\n  5 8 E\n```\n\nTherefore, E3+45=58E in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{58E}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 82 and FD in base-16, we first write out the addition vertically:\n\n```\n  8 2\n+ F D\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add D and 2. D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, and 13+2=15, which is equivalent to F in base-16. So we write down F and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  8 2\n+ F D\n-----\n    1\n```\n\nMoving to the next column, we add F and 8, along with the carried-over 1. F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, so 15+8+1=24, which is equivalent to 18 in base-16 (since we can only use digits 0-9 and A-F). So we write down 8 and carry-over 2 to the next column:\n\n```\n  8 2\n+ F D\n-----\n  1 8\n    2\n```\n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we add 2 and the carried-over 2. This gives us 4, which is equivalent to 4 in base-16. So we write down 4:\n\n```\n  8 2\n+ F D\n-----\n  1 8\n  2 4\n```\n\nTherefore, the result of 82+FD in base-16 is \\boxed{124}.

To add BC and 58 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  BC\n+ 58\n---\n```\n\nWe can then add the digits from right to left, carrying over to the next digit if the sum is greater than F (the largest digit in base-16):\n\n```\n  BC\n+ 58\n---\n   2  (C+8=14, carry 1)\n  6   (B+5=10, plus carried 1 = 11 = B)\n---\n  C4  (result)\n```\n\nTherefore, BC+58 = $\\boxed{C4}$.

To add 7B and AA, we first need to align the digits:\n\n```\n  7B\n+ AA\n---\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and B. A + B = 15 in base-16, which is F. We write down F and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  7B\n+ AA\n---\n   F\n```\n\nNext, we add the next digits, which are B and A (since we already used the A from AA). B + A = 11 in base-16, which is B. We add the carry-over from the previous column (which is 1) and get:\n\n```\n  7B\n+ AA\n---\n  10\n   F\n```\n\nWe write down 0 and carry-over 1 again. Finally, we add the most significant digits, which are 7 and nothing (since we already used the B from 7B). 7 + 1 = 8, so we get:\n\n```\n  7B\n+ AA\n---\n 110\n  0F\n```\n\nTherefore, 7B + AA = 1100F in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{1100F}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add these two numbers, we start by adding the least significant digits, which are 8 and 4. From the addition table, we see that 8+4=12, which is equivalent to C in base-16.

To add D8 and 9E, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  D8\n+ 9E\n---\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is E + 8. In base-16, E + 8 = 14 + 8 = 22, which is equivalent to 6 in base-16 (since we "carry" 1 to the next place value). So we write down 6 in the units place and carry-over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  D8\n+ 9E\n---\n   6\n```\n\nThe next place value is the 16s place (one position to the left of the units place). We add the carried-over 1 to the sum of the digits in this place value: 1 + 8 + 9 = 18. In base-16, 18 is equivalent to 12 (since we "carry" 1 to the next place value). So we write down C in the 16s place and carry-over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  D8\n+ 9E\n---\n  C6\n```\n\nThe next place value is the 256s place (two positions to the left of the units place). There is no carry-over from the previous place value, so we simply add the digits in this place value: D + 9 = 22. In base-16, 22 is equivalent to 16 + 6 = 10 (since we "carry" 1 to the next place value). So we write down A in the 256s place:\n\n```\n  D8\n+ 9E\n---\n AC6\n```\n\nTherefore, D8 + 9E = AC6. \n\n$$\\boxed{AC6}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add F4 and DE in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  F4\n+ DE\n---\n```\n\nWe can then add the rightmost digits, which are 4 and E. In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, so we carry over a 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  F4\n+ DE\n---\n  12\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are F and D. F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, so we carry over another 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  F4\n+ DE\n---\n 112\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 1 and 0:\n\n```\n  F4\n+ DE\n---\n 112\n```\n\nTherefore, F4+DE = 112 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{112}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 94 and 15 in base-16, we start by adding the least significant digits, which are 4 and 5. \n\n4 + 5 = 9 \n\nSince 9 is less than 16, we write down 9 as the least significant digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the next significant digits, which are 9 and 1 (the carry from the previous step). \n\n9 + 1 = 10 \n\nSince 10 is equal to 16 in base-16, we write down 0 as the next significant digit of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 1 and the carry-over from the previous step. \n\n1 + 1 = 2 \n\nSince 2 is less than 16, we write down 2 as the most significant digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, \n\n94 + 15 = 109 \n\nIn base-16, the result is \\boxed{6D}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add E2 and 4E, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  E 2\n+ 4 E\n-----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are 2 and E. In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, so we have:\n\n```\n  E 2\n+ 4 E\n-----\n    10\n```\n\nThe sum of 2 and E is greater than F (which is equivalent to 15 in base-10), so we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-16, this means adding 1 to the next place value. The next place value is the 16's place, so we need to add 1*16 = 16 to the sum. We can write this as:\n\n```\n  E 2\n+ 4 E\n-----\n   110\n```\n\nNow we can add the next digits, which are E and 4. In base-16, 4 is equivalent to 4 in base-10, so we have:\n\n```\n  E 2\n+ 4 E\n-----\n  11 0\n   4\n-----\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are E and 0 (since there are no more digits to carry over).

To add A7 and DE in base-16, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ DE\n---\n```\n\nNext, we can add the digits in the ones place:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ DE\n---\n  15\n```\n\n15 in base-16 is represented as F, so we write down F in the ones place and carry-over 1 to the sixteens place:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ DE\n---\n  F\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the sixteens place, along with the carry-over from the ones place:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ DE\n---\n  10F\n```\n\n10F in base-16 is the same as 16+15, which is 21 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to represent 21 using the digits "0123456789ABCDEF". 21 is equal to 1 sixteens place and 5 ones place, so we write down 5 in the ones place and carry-over 1 to the sixteens place:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ DE\n---\n  10F\n   1\n---\n  1EC\n```\n\nTherefore, A7+DE = \\boxed{1EC} in base-16.

To add AB and AE, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  AB\n+ AE\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that the units digit (the rightmost digit) is B in AB and E in AE. B + E in base-16 is 19, which is larger than 15 (the largest digit in base-16), so we need to carry over to the next digit.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the hexadecimal digits 6C and 9B into their decimal equivalents, perform the addition, and then convert the result back into hexadecimal.\n\nTo convert 6C to decimal, we can use the formula:\n\n6C = 6 x 16^1 + C x 16^0\n\n= 6 x 16 + 12\n\n= 96 + 12\n\n= 108\n\nSimilarly, to convert 9B to decimal, we can use the formula:\n\n9B = 9 x 16^1 + B x 16^0\n\n= 9 x 16 + 11\n\n= 144 + 11\n\n= 155\n\nNow we can add 6C and 9B in decimal:\n\n6C + 9B = 108 + 155\n\n= 263\n\nFinally, we need to convert 263 back into hexadecimal. To do this, we can repeatedly divide by 16 and record the remainders until the quotient is 0. Then we read the remainders in reverse order to get the hexadecimal digits.\n\n263 \xf7 16 = 16 remainder 7 (7 is the least significant digit)\n\n16 \xf7 16 = 1 remainder 0 (0 is the next digit)\n\n1 \xf7 16 = 0 remainder 1 (1 is the most significant digit)\n\nTherefore, 263 in hexadecimal is 107.

To add D4 and BC, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  D 4\n+ B C\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have 4 + C. Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we can rewrite the addition as:\n\n```\n  D 4\n+ B C\n-----\n    10\n```\n\nNext, we have D + B + 1 (from the carry-over). D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, and B is equivalent to 11. Adding these together, we get 24, which is equivalent to 18 in base-16 (since we only have 16 digits in base-16). So we can rewrite the addition as:\n\n```\n  D 4\n+ B C\n-----\n  1 8 10\n```\n\nFinally, we need to convert 18 and 10 to base-16 digits. 18 is equivalent to 12 + 6, which is equivalent to "C6" in base-16. 10 is equivalent to "A" in base-16. So the final result is:\n\n```\n  D 4\n+ B C\n-----\n  1 8 A\n```\n\nTherefore, D4+BC = \\boxed{18A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 9B and 39 in base-16, we first line up the digits:\n\n```\n  9B\n+ 39\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 9 and 9, which gives us 12 in base-10.

A + F = 19 in base-10, which is larger than 9, so we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-16, carrying over means subtracting 16 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So, we have:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 6A\n----\n```\n```\n  9  (carry-over)\n```\n```\n 10\n```\n\nNext, we add the next digits to the carry-over, which are 1 and 6. 1 + 6 + 9 = 16 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-16. So, we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 6A\n----\n   1\n  10\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits to the carry-over, which are 0 and 0. 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, so we write down 1:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 6A\n----\n  89\n```\n\nTherefore, 1F + 6A = \\boxed{89} in base-16.

To add CF and BB in base-16, we first write out the addition in the same way we would in base-10:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ BB\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add C and B.

To add FA and 87 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 87\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 7.

F + 8 + 1 = 18 in base-10, which is 12 in base-16 (since we use A, B, C, D, E, F to represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). We write down the 2 and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 87\n----\n 2B \n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 (since there is no digit in the leftmost column in 87) and 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). 0 + 1 = 1, so we write down the 1:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 87\n----\n 2B \n  1\n```\n\nTherefore, FA + 87 = 2B1 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{2B1}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A4 and 76 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 76\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are 4 and 6. In base-16, 4+6=A, so we write down A as the least significant digit of the result and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 76\n---\n   A\n```\n\nNext, we add the next significant digits, which are A and 7, plus the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-16, A+7+1=12, so we write down 2 as the digit in this column and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 76\n---\n  2A\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 (implicitly) and 1 (from the carry-over). The result is 1, which we write down as the most significant digit of the result:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 76\n---\n 2A1\n```\n\nTherefore, A4+76=2A1 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{2A1}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add AA and 4D, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 4D\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and D. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and D is equivalent to 13. In base-16, we carry over to the next digit when the sum is greater than or equal to 16. In this case, the sum is 23, which is greater than 16, so we carry over 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 4D\n----\n   7\n```\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are A and 4, plus the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and 4 is equivalent to 4. The sum is 15, which is less than 16, so we don't need to carry over:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 4D\n----\n  17\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 (implied) and 4, plus the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. The sum is 5, which is less than 16, so we don't need to carry over:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 4D\n----\n  51\n```\n\nTherefore, AA+4D=51 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{51}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 6. \n\nNext, we move to the sixteens place. We have two 9's, which is equivalent to 2*16 + 2*1 = 32 + 2 = 34. \n\nAdding the 6 in the ones place to the 34 in the sixteens place gives us a final answer of 40. \n\nTherefore, 93+93 = \\boxed{40}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add CF and 2E, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 2E\n----\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is E, and F + E = 1D in base-16. We write down the units digit D and carry-over the 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 2E\n----\n   D\n```\n\nThe next place value is the 16s place (one position to the left of the units place). We add the carry-over 1 to the 16s place value of CF (which is C) and add the 16s place value of 2E (which is 2):\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 2E\n----\n  1D\n```\n\nC + 2 = E, so we write down E in the 16s place:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 2E\n----\n 1DE\n```\n\nTherefore, CF+2E = $\\boxed{1DE}$.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 8A in base-16, we first need to convert the letters to their corresponding decimal values:\n\n8A = 8(16^1) + 10(16^0) = 138\n\nNow we can add:\n\n85 + 138 = 1BD\n\nHowever, since we are in base-16, we need to make sure that the result is expressed using only the digits "0123456789ABCDEF". To do this, we can convert any values greater than 9 back to their corresponding letters:\n\n1BD = 1(16^2) + 11(16^1) + 13(16^0) = 445\n\nTherefore, 85+8A = \\boxed{445} in base-16.

First, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding values in base-10:\nA = 10\nE = 14\n\nNext, we can multiply 2A by 16^6 (since it is in the 7th digit from the right) and E7 by 16^0 (since it is in the 1st digit from the right):\n2A * 16^6 = 2 * 16^7 + 10 * 16^6 = 33,554,432\nE7 * 16^0 = 14 * 16^0 + 7 * 16^1 = 238\n\nFinally, we can add these two values together:\n33,554,432 + 238 = 33,554,670\n\nTherefore, 2A+E7 = \\boxed{33,554,670}.

To add 87 and 6F in base-16, we first need to convert each digit to its decimal equivalent:\n\n8 = 8\n7 = 7\n6 = 6\nF = 15\n\nNext, we add the decimal values of each digit:\n\n8 + 7 + 6 + 15 = 36\n\nSince we are working in base-16, we need to convert 36 back to a hexadecimal digit. The largest hexadecimal digit is F, which has a decimal value of 15. Therefore, we can write 36 as 2F in base-16.\n\nThus, 87 + 6F = 2F in base-16, or \\boxed{2F}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add DD and 1E, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ 1E\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are D and E. In base-16, D represents 13 and E represents 14, so:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ 1E\n----\n  X3\n```\n\nHere, X represents the result of the addition of D and E, which is 13+14=27. However, 27 is not a valid digit in base-16, so we need to "carry" the excess to the next column. In base-16, 27 is equivalent to 1B, so we write down the 7 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ 1E\n----\n  73\n```\n\nNow we move to the next column, which is the 16's place. We add the carried 1 to the next digit, which is D:\n\n```\n  DD\n+ 1E\n----\n  93\n```\n\nAnd we're done! The result is 93 in base-16. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{93}$.

We write the 4 in the ones place and carry the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  7F\n+ 45\n----\n   4\n```\n\nWe then add the next digits, which are 7 and 4, and add the carry from the previous column:\n\n```\n  7F\n+ 45\n----\n  4B\n```\n\nFinally, we have our result: $\\boxed{4B}$.

Adding these two numbers in base-10 gives us 99 + 150 = 249. \n\nTo convert 249 back to base-16, we divide by 16 and get a quotient of 15 with a remainder of 9. We write down the remainder as the least significant digit, and then divide the quotient by 16 again. We get a quotient of 15 with a remainder of 9 again. We repeat this process until the quotient is 0. \n\nThe remainders we get are 9, 9, and 15, which correspond to the digits "9", "9", and "F" in base-16.

To add 4E and EA, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  4E\n+ EA\n---\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is A in EA and E in 4E. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and E is equivalent to 14. Adding them together gives us 1E (15 in base-10), so we write down E and carry-over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  4E\n+ EA\n---\n  1E\n```\n\nNext, we add the values in the 16s place. There is a 0 in 4E and an A (10 in base-10) in EA. Adding them together gives us A, which we write down:\n\n```\n  4E\n+ EA\n---\n 1AE\n```\n\nFinally, we add the values in the 256s place. There is a 4 in 4E and a 0 in EA.

To add 38 and 90 in base-16, we first write out the numbers with their place values:\n\n```\n  3   8\n+ 9   0\n------\n```\n\nNext, we can add the digits in the ones place, which gives us 8 + 0 = 8.

This gives us 3 + 9 + 1 = 13. However, since we are in base-16, we need to write 13 as "D". We write down "D" in the sixteens place of our answer:\n\n```\n  3   8\n+ 9   0\n------\n  1D8\n```\n\nTherefore, 38 + 90 = $\\boxed{1D8}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A7 and 5A, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ 5A\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are 7 and A. In base-16, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ 5A\n----\n  1\n```\n\nThe sum of 7 and A is 11, which is too large to represent with a single digit in base-16. Instead, we write down the least significant digit of the sum, which is 1, and carry the most significant digit, which is 1, to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are A and 5, plus the carry from the previous column:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ 5A\n----\n  11\n```\n\nThe sum of A, 5, and 1 is 10, which is represented by the digit A in base-16. We write down A as the least significant digit of the sum, and carry the most significant digit, which is 1, to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 (since there is no carry from the previous column) and 1:\n\n```\n  A7\n+ 5A\n----\n  11A\n```\n\nTherefore, A7+5A=11A in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{11A}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add C3 and 7B, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  C 3\n+ 7 B\n-----\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is 3 + B = E (since B is 11 in base-10 and 3 + 11 = 14, which is E in base-16). We write down the E and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  C 3\n+ 7 B\n-----\n    E\n```\n\nThe next column is the 16s place (16 to the power of 1). We add the carry-over 1 to C and get D (since C is 12 in base-10 and 1 + 12 = 13, which is D in base-16). Then we add 7 to get 14, which is E in base-16. So the 16s place is E + D = 1B.

To add 48 and 95 in base-16, we first write out the addition table for base-16:\n\n| + | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 |\n| 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 |\n| 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 |\n| 4 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |\n| 5 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |\n| 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\n| 7 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |\n| 8 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 |\n| 9 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |\n| A | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 |\n| B | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A |\n| C | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B |\n| D | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B | 1C |\n| E | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B | 1C | 1D |\n| F | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B | 1C | 1D | 1E |\n\nWe can see that 48 is equivalent to 0x30 in base-16, and 95 is equivalent to 0x5F in base-16. To add these two numbers, we start by adding the least significant digits (the ones place), which are 0 and F. Looking at the addition table, we see that 0 + F = F. So the ones place of the sum is F.\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits (the sixteens place), which are 3 and 5. Looking at the addition table, we see that 3 + 5 = 8. So the sixteens place of the sum is 8.\n\nTherefore, 48 + 95 = 0x8F, or in boxed form, \\boxed{8F}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 94+DF? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert DF to its decimal equivalent. D is equivalent to 13 in decimal and F is equivalent to 15 in decimal. Therefore, DF is equivalent to 13*16 + 15 = 223 in decimal.\n\nNext, we can add 94 and 223 in decimal to get 317.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 317 back to base-16. 317 divided by 16 is 19 with a remainder of 13, which is equivalent to D in base-16. 19 divided by 16 is 1 with a remainder of 3, which is equivalent to 3 in base-16. Therefore, 317 in base-16 is equivalent to \\boxed{133}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add FA and 5D in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 5D\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and D. A + D = 17 in base-10, which is 11 in base-16 (since we only have 16 digits). We write down the 1 and carry over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 5D\n----\n   1\n```\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are F and 5, plus the carried-over 1. F + 5 + 1 = 15 in base-10, which is F in base-16. We write down the F and carry over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 5D\n----\n  1F\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 (since there is no digit in the leftmost column for 5D) and the carried-over 1. 0 + 1 = 1 in base-16. We write down the 1:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 5D\n----\n 1F8\n```\n\nTherefore, FA+5D = \\boxed{1F8} in base-16.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 5E+F1? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 5E and F1, we first align the digits:\n\n```\n  5E\n+ F1\n---\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are E and 1. E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, and 1 is equivalent to 1 in base-10. Adding them together gives us 15 in base-10, which is equivalent to F in base-16. We write down F as the least significant digit and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  5E\n+ F1\n---\n   F\n```\n\nNext, we add the next significant digits, which are 5 and F (the carried-over 1 is added in this step). 5 is equivalent to 5 in base-10, and F is equivalent to 15 in base-10. Adding them together gives us 20 in base-10, which is equivalent to 14 in base-16. We write down 14 as the next significant digit and carry-over 2 to the next column:\n\n```\n  5E\n+ F1\n---\n  4F\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 (the carried-over 2 is added in this step) and 0. 0 is equivalent to 0 in base-10, so the sum is simply 0. We write down 0 as the most significant digit:\n\n```\n  5E\n+ F1\n---\n  4F\n```\n\nTherefore, 5E+F1 = 4F in base-16. \n\n$$\\boxed{4F}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add D6 and 5E, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  D 6\n+ 5 E\n-----\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is 6 + E. Since E is the 14th digit in base-16, we need to carry-over 1 to the next place value:\n\n```\n  D 6\n+ 5 E\n-----\n  C 4\n```\n\nThe next place value is the 16s place (16 to the power of 1). We add D and 5, and also add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n```\n  D 6\n+ 5 E\n-----\n  C 4\n1 2\n```\n\nThe result is 12C in base-16. \n\nTherefore, D6+5E = \\boxed{12C}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add C2 and 16 in base-16, we first need to convert 16 to base-16. \n\n16 in base-16 is represented as 10, since A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, and F=15. \n\nSo, C2+16 becomes C2+10 in base-16. \n\nTo add these two numbers, we start from the rightmost digit and work our way left. \n\n2+0=2, so we write down 2. \n\nNext, we add 1 (from 10) to C, which gives us D. So we write down D. \n\nTherefore, C2+16 in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{D2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A3 and E8 in base-16, we first need to convert each digit to its decimal equivalent:\n\nA = 10\n3 = 3\nE = 14\n8 = 8\n\nNext, we add the decimal values of each digit:\n\n10 + 3 + 14 + 8 = 35\n\nFinally, we convert the decimal sum back to base-16 by finding the remainder when dividing by 16 and converting that remainder to its corresponding base-16 digit:\n\n35 divided by 16 is 2 with a remainder of 3, so the base-16 digit for 3 is 3.\n\nTherefore, A3 + E8 = 35 in base-16, or \n\n\\boxed{23}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add F5 and A5 in base-16, we first need to convert each digit to its decimal equivalent. \n\nF in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, and 5 in base-16 is equivalent to 5 in base-10. Similarly, A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and 5 in base-16 is equivalent to 5 in base-10. \n\nSo, F5 + A5 in base-16 is equivalent to 15*16^1 + 5*16^0 + 10*16^1 + 5*16^0. \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n15*16^1 + 10*16^1 + 5*16^0 + 5*16^0 = (15+10)*16^1 + (5+5)*16^0 = 25*16^1 + 10*16^0\n\nTherefore, F5 + A5 in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{25A}.

To add FB and A8, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  FB\n+ A8\n---\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is 11 in FB and 8 in A8. Adding these gives 19, which is 13 in base-16 (since 19 is greater than or equal to 16, we "carry" the 1 to the next place value). We write down the 3 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  FB\n+ A8\n---\n  3\n```\n\nMoving to the next place value (16s place), we have B in FB and A in A8. Adding these gives 21, which is 15 in base-16 (since 21 is greater than or equal to 16, we carry the 1 to the next place value). We write down the 5 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  FB\n+ A8\n---\n  35\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carry (1) to the next place value (256s place) in FB, which is F.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the hexadecimal numbers 2C and B7 into decimal numbers, add them together, and then convert the result back into hexadecimal.\n\nFirst, let's convert 2C to decimal. The digit 2 is in the 16's place, and the digit C is in the 1's place. Using the formula for converting from hexadecimal to decimal, we have:\n\n2C = 2*16^1 + C*16^0\n   = 2*16 + 12\n   = 44\n\nNext, let's convert B7 to decimal. The digit B is in the 16's place, and the digit 7 is in the 1's place. Using the same formula, we have:\n\nB7 = B*16^1 + 7*16^0\n   = 11*16 + 7\n   = 183\n\nNow we can add these two decimal numbers together:\n\n2C + B7 = 44 + 183\n        = 227\n\nFinally, we need to convert 227 back into hexadecimal. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 16 and keeping track of the remainders. The remainders, in reverse order, give us the hexadecimal digits. Here's the process:\n\n227 / 16 = 14 remainder 3 (3 is the least significant digit)\n 14 / 16 = 0 remainder 14 (14 is the most significant digit)\n\nSo the hexadecimal representation of 227 is DF.

To add E4 and 62 in base-16, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  E 4\n+ 6 2\n-----\n```\n\nNext, we can add the least significant digits, which are 4 and 2:\n\n```\n  E 4\n+ 6 2\n-----\n    6\n```\n\nThe sum of 4 and 2 is 6, so we write down 6 as the least significant digit of the result. Next, we move on to the next place value, which is 16^1 or 16. We add the digits in this place value, which are E and 6, and also add any carry from the previous step (which is 0 in this case):\n\n```\n  E 4\n+ 6 2\n-----\n  10 6\n```\n\nThe sum of E and 6 is 14, which is too large to represent with a single digit in base-16.

To add D7 and 90 in base-16, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  D 7\n+ 9 0\n-----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are 7 and 0.

To add CB and B5 in base-16, we first line up the digits:\n\n```\n  CB\n+ B5\n---\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add C and 5. C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, and 5 is equivalent to 5 in base-10. Adding them together gives us 17 in base-10, which is equivalent to 11 in base-16 (since we only have 16 digits to work with).

To add F1 and DF in base-16, we first line up the digits:\n\n```\n  F1\n+ DF\n---\n```\n\nWe start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and F. In base-16, F represents the value 15, so we have:\n\n```\n  F1\n+ DF\n---\n  10\n```\n\nThe sum of 1 and F is 10, which we write as a 0 in the ones place and carry a 1 to the sixteens place. We then add the digits in the sixteens place, which are F and D. In base-16, D represents the value 13, so we have:\n\n```\n  F1\n+ DF\n---\n 110\n```\n\nThe sum of F and D is 1C, but we carry the 1 from the previous step, so the sum is actually 1D. We write this as a D in the sixteens place and a 1 in the 256s place (which we don't need to worry about for this problem).

To add CF and 7A, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 7A\n----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and F. In base-16, A + F = 19, which is 13 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to represent this as a two-digit number. We can do this by writing 13 as D (since D is the 13th digit in our base-16 system) and carrying over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 7A\n----\n   D\n```\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are 7 and C. In base-16, 7 + C = 13, which is D in base-16. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. So we have:\n\n```\n  CF\n+ 7A\n----\n  1D\n   D\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are C and 0. In base-16, C + 0 = C.

We can then add the next digits, which are D and A. In base-16, A represents the value 10 and D represents the value 13, so we have:\n\n```\n  D8\n+ AE\n---\n  16\n  C\n```\n\nAdding D and A gives us 17, which we write as a 7 in the ones place and carry-over the 1 to the sixteens place. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (from the carry-over). This gives us:\n\n```\n  D8\n+ AE\n---\n  16\n  C7\n```\n\nTherefore, D8+AE = \\boxed{C7}.

To add 5D and EF, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  5D\n+ EF\n---\n```\n\nThe units place (rightmost digit) is D + F. In base-16, D represents 13 and F represents 15. Adding them together gives us 28, which is too large to represent in one digit in base-16. Instead, we need to "carry" the 1 to the next place value (the 16s place):\n\n```\n  5D\n+ EF\n---\n  14\n```\n\nNow we move on to the 16s place. 5 + E (which represents 14) is 19 in base-10, which is also too large to represent in one digit in base-16. So we carry the 1 to the next place value (the 256s place):\n\n```\n  5D\n+ EF\n---\n 114\n```\n\nTherefore, 5D + EF = 114 in base-16. \n\n$\\boxed{114}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 48+F9? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert F9 to its decimal equivalent. F in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, and 9 in base-16 is equivalent to 9 in base-10. Therefore, F9 in base-16 is equivalent to 15*16^1 + 9*16^0 in base-10, which simplifies to 249.\n\nNext, we add 48 to 249: 249 + 48 = 297.\n\nFinally, we convert 297 back to base-16. 297 divided by 16 is 18 with a remainder of 9 (since the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 297 is 16*18=288, and 297-288=9). Therefore, the first digit in our base-16 representation is 9. 18 divided by 16 is 1 with a remainder of 2, so the second digit in our base-16 representation is 2. Therefore, 48+F9 = \\boxed{292}.

To add 1C and BE in base-16, we can start by aligning the digits:\n\n  1C\n+ BE\n----\n  \nNext, we can add the rightmost digits, which are C and E in this case. In base-16, C represents the value 12 and E represents the value 14. Adding them gives us 1C:\n\n  1C\n+ BE\n----\n  1C\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 16's place. We add the values of 1 and B, which represent 1 and 11 in base-16, respectively. This gives us 12 in base-16, which is represented by the digit C:\n\n  1C\n+ BE\n----\n 1C\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 256's place.

However, since we are working in base-16, we need to write -3 as a positive number using the digits "0123456789ABCDEF". The largest digit that is less than or equal to -3 is F, since F is equal to 15 in base-10. Therefore, we write down F as the sixteens digit of our answer, and carry the 1 over to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 256s place, which are the carried 1 and the 1 from the 128s place. This gives us 1+1=2, which we write down as the 256s digit of our answer.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n55+80 = 135 = \\boxed{87}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert 9C and 13 into base-10, add them together, and then convert the result back into base-16.\n\nTo convert 9C to base-10, we can use the formula:\n\n9C = 9*16^1 + 12*16^0 = 144 + 12 = 156\n\nTo convert 13 to base-10, we can simply write:\n\n13 = 1*16^1 + 3*16^0 = 16 + 3 = 19\n\nNow we can add 156 and 19 together:\n\n156 + 19 = 175\n\nFinally, we need to convert 175 back into base-16. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 16 and keeping track of the remainders. The remainders, read from bottom to top, give us the base-16 representation of the number. Here's the process:\n\n175 \xf7 16 = 10 remainder 15 (F)\n10 \xf7 16 = 0 remainder 10 (A)\n\nSo 175 in base-16 is AF.

Adding them gives us 1A, which we write under the line and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  AD\n+ A7\n---\n  1A\n```\n\nWe then move to the next digits from the right, which are A and A. In base-16, A represents the value 10. Adding them gives us 14, but we need to add the carried 1 from the previous step, giving us 15. We write 5 under the line and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  AD\n+ A7\n---\n 15A\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and A. Adding them gives us A, which we write under the line:\n\n```\n  AD\n+ A7\n---\n 15A\n   A\n```\n\nTherefore, AD+A7=15A, and the result is $\\boxed{15A}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to know the values of the hexadecimal digits "5B" and "9A". \n\nThe digit "5" in hexadecimal represents the value 5 in base-10, and the digit "B" represents the value 11 in base-10. Therefore, "5B" in hexadecimal represents the value:\n\n5B = 5*16^1 + 11*16^0 = 80 + 11 = 91\n\nSimilarly, the digit "9" in hexadecimal represents the value 9 in base-10, and the digit "A" represents the value 10 in base-10.

To add A4 and 14 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 14\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that 4 + 4 = 8, so we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 14\n---\n   8\n```\n\nNext, we move to the second digit from the right. We have 1 + A = B (remember that A, B, C, D, E, F represent 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 in base-16), so we write down B as the next digit of the result:\n\n```\n  A4\n+ 14\n---\n  B8\n```\n\nTherefore, A4 + 14 = \\boxed{B8} in base-16.

To add FF and 72 in base-16, we first line up the digits:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ 72\n----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 2 and F. In base-16, F represents the value 15, so 2+F is equal to 11 in base-10 (or B in base-16). We write down the B and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ 72\n----\n  B\n```\n\nMoving to the next column, we add the carry-over 1 to the next digit of FF, which is F. 1+F is equal to 16 in base-10 (or 10 in base-16), so we write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 again:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ 72\n----\n 0B\n```\n\nContinuing in this way, we add the next digits and any carry-overs until we reach the leftmost digit:\n\n```\n  FF\n+ 72\n----\n 0B1\n```\n\nTherefore, FF+72 = \\boxed{0B1} in base-16.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 8E+AA? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 8E and AA in base-16, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  8E\n+ AA\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are both A in this case. A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so:\n\n```\n  8E\n+ AA\n---\n  18\n```\n\nThe result of adding A and A is 10 in base-16, which is equivalent to 16 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the next most significant digits, which are E and A. E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, and A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. Adding these together, we get:\n\n```\n  8E\n+ AA\n---\n  28\n```\n\nAgain, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are both 8 in this case. Adding these together, we get:\n\n```\n  8E\n+ AA\n---\n 118\n```\n\nTherefore, 8E+AA in base-16 is equivalent to \\boxed{118} in base-16.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add D0 and 7B in base-16, we first align the digits:\n\n```\n  D 0\n+ 7 B\n-----\n```\n\nNext, we add the least significant digits, which are 0 and B. In base-16, B represents the value 11, so we have:\n\n```\n  D 0\n+ 7 B\n-----\n    B\n```\n\nThe sum of 0 and B is B, but we also have a carry of 1 to the next column. We add this carry to the next column, which gives us:\n\n```\n  D 0\n+ 7 B\n-----\n  1 2\n    B\n```\n\nNext, we add the next most significant digits, which are 1 and 7. In base-16, 7 represents the value 7, so we have:\n\n```\n  D 0\n+ 7 B\n-----\n  1 2\n  7 B\n```\n\nThe sum of 1 and 7 is 8, so we write down 8 and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  D 0\n+ 7 B\n-----\n  1 2\n  8 B\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 and D. In base-16, D represents the value 13, so we have:\n\n```\n  D 0\n+ 7 B\n-----\n  1 2\n  8 B\n  D\n```\n\nThe sum of 0 and D is D, so we write down D as the final digit of the sum. Therefore, D0+7B=12B in base-16, or $\\boxed{12B}$ in our final answer.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 3F and E7, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  3F\n+ E7\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are F and 7. In base-16, F + 7 = 16 + 1 = 11 (where we carry-over 1 to the next column). So we write down 1 and 1 as the result, and carry-over the 1:\n\n```\n  3F\n+ E7\n---\n  11\n```\n\nNext, we add the next digits, which are 3 and E (which is equivalent to 14 in base-10). 3 + E + 1 (the carry-over) = 18. In base-16, 18 is equivalent to 12 with a carry-over of 1. So we write down 2 (which is equivalent to C in base-16) and carry-over the 1:\n\n```\n  3F\n+ E7\n---\n  1C\n```\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 and 0 (since we ran out of digits to carry-over). 0 + 0 + 1 (the carry-over) = 1. So we write down 1 as the final result:\n\n```\n  3F\n+ E7\n---\n  1C1\n```\n\nTherefore, 3F+E7 = \\boxed{1C1}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add B6 and AF in base-16, we first need to convert each digit to its decimal equivalent:\n\nB6 = 11*16^1 + 6*16^0 = 176 + 6 = 182\nAF = 10*16^1 + 15*16^0 = 160 + 15 = 175\n\nNow we can add these decimal values:\n\n182 + 175 = 357\n\nFinally, we convert the decimal result back to base-16:\n\n357 = 22*16^1 + 5*16^0 = 16*16^1 + 6*16^1 + 5*16^0 = 165\n\nTherefore, B6+AF = \\boxed{165} in base-16.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the hexadecimal numbers 7C and 34 into decimal numbers, add them together, and then convert the result back into hexadecimal.\n\nFirst, let's convert 7C to decimal. The digit 7 represents 7*16^1 = 112, and the digit C represents 12*16^0 = 12. Therefore, 7C in decimal is 112 + 12 = 124.\n\nNext, let's convert 34 to decimal. The digit 3 represents 3*16^1 = 48, and the digit 4 represents 4*16^0 = 4. Therefore, 34 in decimal is 48 + 4 = 52.\n\nNow we can add 124 and 52 together to get 176.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 176 back into hexadecimal. The largest power of 16 that is less than or equal to 176 is 16^1, which goes into 176 11 times with a remainder of 0. The largest power of 16 that is less than or equal to 0 is 16^0, which goes into 0 0 times with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 176 in hexadecimal is B0.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n7C + 34 = 124 + 52 = 176 = \\boxed{B0}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add BD and 7E in base-16, we can start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  BD\n+ 7E\n----\n```\n\nWe can then add the least significant digits, which are E and D:\n\n```\n  BD\n+ 7E\n----\n  1D\n```\n\nThe result of adding E and D in base-16 is 1D. We write down the least significant digit (D) and carry-over the most significant digit (1). We can then add the next least significant digits, which are B and 7, along with the carry-over:\n\n```\n  BD\n+ 7E\n----\n 1D\n+ 1\n----\n 9C\n```\n\nThe result of adding B, 7, and 1 in base-16 is 9C.

First, we need to convert 55 and 78 to base-10 to perform the addition. \n\n55 in base-16 is equal to 5*16^1 + 5*16^0 = 85 in base-10. \n\n78 in base-16 is equal to 7*16^1 + 8*16^0 = 120 in base-10. \n\nNow we can add 85 and 120 in base-10: \n\n85 + 120 = 205 \n\nFinally, we need to convert 205 back to base-16: \n\n205 in base-10 is equal to 12*16^1 + 13*16^0 = CD in base-16. \n\nTherefore, 55+78 = \\boxed{CD}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To convert 8E+28 to base-16, we need to first convert it to base-10. \n\n8E+28 = 8 x 16^28 \n\nNow we can convert this to base-16. \n\nStarting from the left, we divide 8 x 16^28 by 16^7 (which is the largest power of 16 that is less than or equal to 8E+28). \n\n8 x 16^28 / 16^7 = 8 x 16^21 \n\nSo the leftmost digit is 8. \n\nNext, we take the remainder (8 x 16^21) and divide it by 16^6. \n\n8 x 16^21 / 16^6 = 8 x 16^15 \n\nSo the second digit from the left is also 8. \n\nWe continue this process until we have converted the entire number to base-16. \n\n8E+28 = 88 8888 8888 8888 8888 8888 8888 \n\nTherefore, \\boxed{8E+28 = 88 8888 8888 8888 8888 8888 8888}.

To add 1F and 82 in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 82\n----\n```\n\nWe can see that the rightmost digit of 1F is F, which has a value of 15 in base-10. The rightmost digit of 82 is 2, which has a value of 2 in base-10. Adding these two digits gives us 11 in base-10, which is B in base-16. We write down the B in the result and carry-over the 1:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 82\n----\n  B\n```\n\nNext, we move to the second digit from the right. The digit in 1F is 1, which has a value of 16 in base-10 (since we are in base-16). We add this to the carried-over 1 from the previous step, giving us a total of 17 in base-10. In base-16, 17 is represented by the digit 11 (since we only have digits up to F). We write down the 1 in the result and carry-over the 1 again:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 82\n----\n1 B\n```\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit. The digit in 1F is F, which has a value of 15 in base-10. We add this to the carried-over 1 from the previous step, giving us a total of 16 in base-10. In base-16, 16 is represented by the digit 10. We write down the 0 in the result and carry-over the 1:\n\n```\n  1F\n+ 82\n----\n1B0\n```\n\nTherefore, 1F+82 = \\boxed{1B0} in base-16.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add FE and FB in base-16, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  FE\n+ FB\n---\n```\n\nWe start by adding the least significant digits, which are E and B. E + B = 15 + 11 = 26.

We then add the next digits to the left, which are B and 7, and add the carry from the previous column (which is 2, since 27 in base-16 is 1F, and we carried over the 1):\n\n```\n  BF\n+ 7C\n----\n  3 3\n```\n\nIn base-16, B+7+2 = 14+2 = 16, which is equal to 10 in base-16, so we write down 0 in the third column from the right, and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  BF\n+ 7C\n----\n  3 3\n  1\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 (since we carried over the 1) and 0:\n\n```\n  BF\n+ 7C\n----\n  3 3\n1 0\n```\n\nSo BF+7C = 103 in base-16.
