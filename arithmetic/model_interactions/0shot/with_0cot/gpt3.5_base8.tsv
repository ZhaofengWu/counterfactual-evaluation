To add 57 and 44 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 4. This gives us 13 in base-8, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 13 is not a valid digit in base-8. \n\nTo carry over, we need to add 1 to the next digit to the left, which is the 5 in 57. This gives us 6, and we can add the carried-over 1 to get 7. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 5 and 4. This gives us 11 in base-8, but we need to carry over again. We add 1 to the next digit to the left, which is the 1 in 57, to get 2. We can then add the carried-over 1 to get 3. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0. We don't need to carry over this time. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }57\\\\\n&+44\\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&\\boxed{123}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 57+44 in base-8 is \\boxed{123}.

To add 60 and 57 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 7. This gives us 7, with no carry-over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the second rightmost digits, which are 6 and 5. This gives us 13 in base-8. However, since 13 is a two-digit number in base-8, we need to carry-over the leftmost digit (1) to the next digit. So we write down 3 as the second rightmost digit, and carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (plus the carry-over of 1 from the previous step).

We add the digits in this place, which are 6 and 2, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). \n\n6 + 2 + 0 = 10 \n\nSince we are in base-8, we need to regroup this as 1 group of 8 and 2 left over. So the digit in the 8's place of our answer is 2, and we carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 64's place, which are 1 and 0 (plus any carry-over from the previous step, which is 1). \n\n1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \n\nSo the digit in the 64's place of our answer is 2. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n61 + 23 = 104 \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{104}.

In the eights place, we have 2+7=11, which is written as "13" in base-8 (since 11 is one more than the largest digit, 7, in base-8). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{133}_8.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 46+41? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 46 and 41 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which gives us 6+1=7. We write down the 7 in the ones place of our answer. \n\nNext, we move on to the eights place digits. We have 4 eights in 46 and 4 eights in 41, which gives us a total of 8 eights. However, 8 in base-8 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nMoving on to the next place value, we have 1 eight from the carry-over plus 6 eights from 46 and 4 eights from 41, which gives us a total of 11 eights. However, 11 in base-8 is equivalent to 9 in base-10, so we write down 1 in the eights place of our answer and carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we move on to the next place value, which is the 64s place. We have 1 sixty-four from the carry-over plus 4 sixty-fours from 46 and 4 sixty-fours from 41, which gives us a total of 9 sixty-fours. We write down 1 in the sixty-fours place of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 46+41=110 in base-8, which we can write as $\\boxed{110_8}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We write down the remainder (9 mod 8 = 1) and carry the quotient (9 div 8 = 1) to the next column:\n\n27 = 0 3 3\n36 = 0 4 6\n      -----\n     0 1 11\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, along with the carry:\n\n3 + 4 + 1 = 8\n\nSince 8 is equal to 8, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n27 = 0 3 3\n36 = 0 4 6\n      -----\n     0 11 11\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, along with the carry:\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo the final result is:\n\n27 + 36 = 0 1 1 1 1 \\boxed{1111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 47+43? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 47 and 43 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which gives us 7+3=12. However, since we are in base-8, we need to regroup any values greater than or equal to 8. In this case, we can regroup the 12 as 1 eight and 4 ones. So, the ones place of our sum is 4 and we carry-over the 1 eight to the next place.\n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which gives us 4+4 (from the carry-over) + 7+3 = 18. Again, we need to regroup any values greater than or equal to 8. We can regroup the 18 as 2 eights and 2 ones. So, the eights place of our sum is 2 and we carry-over the other 1 eight to the next place.\n\nFinally, we add the sixty-fours place digits, which gives us 1+1 (from the carry-over) = 2. So, our final sum is 217 in base-8.\n\nTherefore, 47+43 = \\boxed{217}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 73 and 43 in base-8, we first need to add the ones place digits, which are 3 and 3. This gives us 6 in base-8. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 7 and 4. This gives us 13 in base-8. However, since we are working in base-8, we can only use digits 0-7. Therefore, we need to "carry over" the extra 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the fourty-eights place digit, which is 1. This gives us 2. \n\nTherefore, 73+43=116 in base-8, which we can write as $\\boxed{116_8}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 50 and 40 in base-8, we first write out the numbers in full:\n\n50 = 5*8^1 + 0*8^0 = 40 + 10\n40 = 4*8^1 + 0*8^0\n\nThen we add the digits in the ones place, which gives us 0+0=0. We write down the 0 in the ones place of our answer.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the eights place, which gives us 4+5=11. Since 11 is greater than or equal to 8, we need to carry over to the next place. We write down a 3 in the eights place of our answer (since 11-8=3), and carry over the 1 to the next place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the sixty-fours place, which gives us 1+0=1. We write down the 1 in the sixty-fours place of our answer.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n50+40 = 110_8 = \\boxed{72}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In the eights place, we have 2+7=11, which is written as "13" in base-8 (since 11 is one more than the largest digit, 7, in base-8). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{133}_8.

To add 57 and 44 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 4. This gives us 13 in base-8, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 13 is not a valid digit in base-8. \n\nTo carry over, we need to add 1 to the next digit to the left, which is the 5 in 57. This gives us 6, and we can add the carried-over 1 to get 7. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 5 and 4. This gives us 11 in base-8, but we need to carry over again. We add 1 to the next digit to the left, which is the 1 in 57, to get 2. We can then add the carried-over 1 to get 3. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0.

To add 67 and 25 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which gives us 7+5=12. Since 12 is greater than 7 (the largest digit in base-8), we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value.

To add 50 and 42 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 2. This gives us 2, with no carry-over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the second rightmost digits, which are 5 and 4. This gives us 11 in base-8. However, since we are working with base-8, we can only use digits 0-7. Therefore, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (plus the carry-over of 1 from the previous step). This gives us 2.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

First, we need to add the digits in the ones place, which are 4 and 3. This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move on to the eights place. We have 6 eights from 64 and 7 eights from carrying over the 1 from the ones place. This gives us 13 eights, which we can write as 15 in base-8 (since 1 eight is equivalent to 1 ten in base-10). \n\nTherefore, 64+63 in base-8 is \\boxed{137}.

We write down the 7 in the ones place of our answer. \n\nThen, we move on to the eights place. We have 5+5=12 in the eights place, but since we are in base-8, we need to regroup. 12 in base-8 is equivalent to 1 eight and 4 ones. So we write down the 4 in the eights place of our answer, and carry the 1 over to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the 1 from the previous step to the fifties place, which gives us 1+1=2. We write down the 2 in the fifties place of our answer.\n\nTherefore, 51+56=104 in base-8, or $\\boxed{104_8}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 70 and 72 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 2. This gives us 2, with no carry-over to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the middle digits, which are 7 and 7. This gives us 16 in base-8, which is written as 20 with a carry-over of 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 1 (from the carry-over).

To add 63 and 65 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 5. \n\n3 + 5 = 6 (in base-8)\n\nSince 6 is less than 8, we can write down the 6 in the ones place. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digit from the right, which is the 8's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 8's place, which are 6 and 5. \n\n0 + 6 + 5 = 13 (in base-8)\n\nSince 13 is greater than or equal to 8, we need to carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Specifically, we can write down the 5 in the 8's place, and carry-over the 1 to the next place value (which is the 64's place). \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 64's place, which are 0 and 6. \n\n1 + 0 + 6 = 7 (in base-8)\n\nSince 7 is less than 8, we can write down the 7 in the 64's place. \n\nTherefore, 63 + 65 = 130 in base-8, which we can write as $\\boxed{130}$.

To add 67 and 13 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 3. This gives us 10 in base-8, which we write as a 0 and carry-over a 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the 1 we carried-over to the next column, to the digits in that column. The digits in the next column are 6 and 1. Adding 1 to 6 gives us 7, so we write down 7 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 67+13 in base-8 is equal to 100, which we write as \\boxed{100}.

To add 76 and 17 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 7. These add up to 13, which is larger than the largest digit in base-8 (which is 7). Therefore, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe next digit in 76 is 7, but we need to add 1 to it because of the carry-over. So we have 7+1=10 in the second digit of the sum. \n\nNow we move to the leftmost digit in 76, which is 0. We add this to the carried-over 1, which gives us 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digit in 17, which is 1, to the sum we have so far.

This gives us 10 again, but we need to carry over another 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the sixty-fours place, which are 0 and 1 (from the carried over 1).

To add 77 and 41 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 1. This gives us 10 in base-8, which we can write as "12" (since the digit "8" is not allowed in base-8). We write down the "2" and carry-over the "1" to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are both 7. We also add the carried-over "1" from the previous step. This gives us 15 in base-8, which we can write as "17". We write down the "7" and carry-over the "1" to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0. We also add the carried-over "1" from the previous step. This gives us 1 in base-8, which we can write as "1". We write down the "1" to the left of the previous digits. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}7\\phantom{1}\\\\\n&+41\\\\\n&\\underline{\\phantom{00}7\\phantom{1}}\\\\\n&\\phantom{0}12\\phantom{1}\\\\\n&+ \\underline{\\phantom{0}17}\\\\\n&\\phantom{0}31\\phantom{1}\\\\\n&+ \\underline{\\phantom{0}01}\\\\\n&\\boxed{32}\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 77+41 in base-8 is equal to \\boxed{32}.

Adding these gives us 11 in base-8. However, since we are working in base-8, we can only use digits 0-7. Therefore, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next digit. \n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, we add the carried-over 1 to the 2 in 22, giving us 3.

To add 41 and 67 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 7. This gives us 10 in base-8, but since we can only use digits 0-7, we carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the middle digits, which are 4 and 6, and we also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 13 in base-8, but again we need to carry over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1, and we also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 2 in base-8. \n\nTherefore, 41+67 in base-8 is equal to \\boxed{132}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 37 and 42 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which are 7 and 2. \n\n7 + 2 = 11 \n\nSince we are in base-8, we need to regroup the 11 as 1 eight and 3 ones. So we write down the 3 in the ones place and carry the 1 over to the eights place. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 3 and 4, and add the carried-over 1: \n\n3 + 4 + 1 = 10 \n\nAgain, we need to regroup the 10 as 1 sixty-four (8 squared), 2 eights, and 2 ones. So we write down the 2 in the eights place and carry the 1 over to the sixty-fours place. \n\nFinally, we add the sixty-fours place digits, which are 1 and 0, and add the carried-over 1: \n\n1 + 0 + 1 = 2 \n\nTherefore, 37 + 42 = 121 in base-8. \n\n\\boxed{121}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 54 and 71 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which are 4 and 1. This gives us 5, which we write down as the ones place digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move on to the eights place digits, which are 5 and 7. Adding these gives us 12 in base-8. However, since we are working in base-8, we can only use digits 0-7. Therefore, we need to "carry over" the extra 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the "carried over" 1 to the next place value, which is the 64s place. The 64s place digits are 0 and 1 (from the carried over 1). Adding these gives us 1, which we write down as the 64s place digit of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 54+71 in base-8 is equal to \\boxed{126}.

This gives us 11.\n\nHowever, since we are in base-8, we cannot have a digit greater than 7. So we need to "carry over" the extra digit, which means adding 1 to the next place value. In this case, we carry over 1 to the 64s place.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 64s place, which are 1 and 0 (from the carry-over).

We have 4 eights in 46 and 4 eights in 41, which gives us a total of 8 eights. However, 8 in base-8 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nMoving on to the next place value, we have 1 eight from the carry-over plus 6 eights from 46 and 4 eights from 41, which gives us a total of 11 eights.

This gives us 4. Again, since 4 is less than 8, we write down 4 in the second column of our answer.\n\nFinally, we add the digits 0 and 1 in the leftmost column, as well as any carry from the previous column (which is 0 in this case).

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 43+37? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 43 and 37 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which are 3 and 7. \n\n3 + 7 = 10 in base-8. \n\nSince we are working in base-8, we can't write "10" as we normally would in base-10. Instead, we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nIn base-8, 10 is equivalent to 1*8 + 2*1. So we write down the "2" in the ones place and carry the "1" over to the eights place. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 4 and 3 (from 43). \n\n4 + 3 + 1 (the carried-over digit) = 10 in base-8. \n\nAgain, we can't write "10" in base-8, so we carry over to the next place value. \n\nIn base-8, 10 is equivalent to 1*8 + 2*1. So we write down the "2" in the eights place and carry the "1" over to the next place value (which is the 64s place, since we're adding two-digit numbers). \n\nFinally, we add the 64s place digits, which are both 0 (since neither 43 nor 37 has a 64s place digit). \n\n0 + 0 + 1 (the carried-over digit) = 1 in base-8. \n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n43 + 37 = 102 in base-8. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 17 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 7. These add up to 13, which is larger than the largest digit in base-8 (which is 7). Therefore, we need to carry over to the next digit. \n\nThe next digit in 76 is 7, but we need to add 1 to it because of the carry-over. So we have 7+1=10 in the second digit of the sum. \n\nNow we move to the leftmost digit in 76, which is 0. We add this to the carried-over 1, which gives us 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digit in 17, which is 1, to the sum we have so far. This gives us 10. \n\nTherefore, 76+17 in base-8 is \\boxed{125}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 26 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 6. This gives us 13 in base-8, which is written as "15" (since 1 eight and 5 ones make 13). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the left, which are both 7. We also need to add any carry-over from the previous column, which is 1 (since 7+6=13, and 13 in base-8 is written as "15"). So we have 7+7+1=15 in base-8, which is written as "23" (since 2 eights and 3 ones make 15). \n\nTherefore, 77+26 in base-8 is equal to "2305". \n\n\\boxed{2305}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 24 and 47 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which are 4 and 7. This gives us 4+7=13. However, in base-8, we only have digits up to 7, so we need to regroup. We can write 13 as 1 eight and 5 ones, or 15 in base-10. We write down the 5 in the ones place and carry the 1 to the eights place. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 2 and 4 (the digit in front of the ones place). We also need to add the carried 1 from the previous step. This gives us 2+4+1=7. \n\nTherefore, 24+47 in base-8 is equal to 73. \n\n\\boxed{73}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 43 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 3. This gives us 10 in base-8, which we can write as "12" (since the digit "8" is not allowed in base-8).

To add 67 and 47 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 7. This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 eight and 6 ones. We write down the 6 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 6 (from 67) and 4 (from 47), and we add the carried 1 from the previous column.

To add 72 and 47 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which are 2 and 7. 2+7=11 in base-10, but since we are working in base-8, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next place value. So the sum of the ones place digits is 1, and we carry over 1 to the eights place. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 7 and 4. We also need to add the 1 that we carried over from the ones place. 7+4+1=12 in base-10, but since we are working in base-8, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next place value. So the sum of the eights place digits is 2, and we carry over 1 to the sixty-fours place. \n\nFinally, we add the sixty-fours place digits, which are 0 and 1 (the 1 that we carried over from the eights place). 0+1=1, so the sum of the sixty-fours place digits is 1. \n\nTherefore, 72+47=121 in base-8. \n\n\\boxed{121}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

However, 10 is not a valid digit in base-8, so we need to carry over to the next column.

First, we need to add the digits in the ones place, which are 5 and 7. In base-8, 5+7=12, but since we only have digits up to 7, we need to carry over to the next place value.

We can regroup by carrying over 1 to the eights place, and writing down the remainder of 12 when divided by 8, which is 4. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 7 and 3 (since we carried over 1 from the ones place). This gives us 7+3+1=11. Again, we need to regroup, so we carry over 1 to the next place value, and write down the remainder of 11 when divided by 8, which is 3. \n\nFinally, we have no more place values to add, so we can write down our answer as 110 in base-8. \n\nTherefore, 73+37=110 in base-8, or $\\boxed{110}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 45+67? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to add the ones place, which is 5+7=12. Since 12 is greater than 7, we need to carry over to the next place value.

Then there exists a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ such that $p_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$ and $\\deg(p_n) \\leq n$ for all $n$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe will prove this by induction on $n$. The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the lemma. Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. We will construct a polynomial $p_{n+1}$ of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $x_0=0$, $x_1=1$, and $x_2=\\frac{1}{2}$. Let $y_0=f(0)$, $y_1=f(1)$, and $y_2=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Let $p_1(x)$ be the line that passes through $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$, and let $p_2(x)$ be the line that passes through $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$. Then, $p_1(x)$ and $p_2(x)$ are both linear functions, so they can be written as $ax+b$ and $cx+d$, respectively. We have $a+b=1$ and $c+d=0$, so $d=-c$ and $a+b=1$. Thus, $p_2(x)=cx-c$.\n\nNow, we want to find a polynomial $p_3(x)$ of degree at most $3$ that passes through $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2},f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)$. We can write $p_3(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$. We know that $d=0$ and $a+b=1$. We also know that $p_3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, so $a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3+b\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+c\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Finally, we know that $p_3(1)=1$, so $a+b+c+d=1$. Solving this system of equations, we get $a=\\frac{4}{3}$, $b=-\\frac{1}{3}$, $c=-\\frac{2}{3}$, and $d=0$. Thus, $p_3(x)=\\frac{4}{3}x^3-\\frac{1}{3}x^2-\\frac{2}{3}x$.\n\nNow, we want to find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=p_3(x)$. We can do this by integrating the difference between the two functions from $0$ to $1$. We have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^1 (f(x)-p_3(x))\\,dx &= \\int_0^1 \\left(x^2-\\frac{4}{3}x^3+\\frac{1}{3}x^2+\\frac{2}{3}x\\right)\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}x^3+\\frac{4}{3}x^2+\\frac{2}{3}x\\right)\\,dx \\\\\n&= \\left[-\\frac{1}{3}x^4+\\frac{4}{9}x^3+\\frac{1}{6}x^2\\right]_0^1 \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{4}{9}+\\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{1}{18}}.\n\\end{align*}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Then there exists a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ such that $p_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$ and $\\deg(p_n) \\leq n$ for all $n$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe will prove this by induction on $n$. The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the lemma. Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. We will construct a polynomial $p_{n+1}$ of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $x_0=0$, $x_1=\\frac{1}{n+1}$, $x_2=\\frac{2}{n+1}$, $\\ldots$, $x_n=1$. Let $p_{n+1}(x)$ be the unique polynomial of degree at most $n+1$ that passes through the points $(x_i,f(x_i))$ for $i=0,1,\\ldots,n$. Then $p_{n+1}(x)$ is given by\n\\[p_{n+1}(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) \\prod_{j \\neq i} \\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j}.\\]\nNote that $p_{n+1}(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$ since it is a linear combination of the polynomials $x^k$ for $k=0,1,\\ldots,n+1$. Also, $p_{n+1}(x)$ agrees with $f(x)$ at the $n+1$ points $x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_n$, so $p_{n+1}$ is a polynomial that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. $\\blacksquare$\n\nNow, we can prove the main result. Let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1+x^2}$. Then $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and differentiable on $(0,1)$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= -\\frac{2x}{(1+x^2)^2} \\\\\nf''(x) &= \\frac{2(3x^2-1)}{(1+x^2)^3}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, $f''(x) > 0$ for $0 < x < 1/\\sqrt{3}$ and $f''(x) < 0$ for $x > 1/\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $f$ is concave up on $[0,1/\\sqrt{3}]$ and concave down on $[1/\\sqrt{3},1]$. By the mean value theorem, there exists a $c \\in (0,1)$ such that\n\\[\\frac{f(1)-f(0)}{1-0} = f'(c) = \\frac{2c}{(1+c^2)^2}.\\]\nThus, $c^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, so $c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.

We also need to add the 1 that we carried over from the ones place. This gives us 14 in base-8. Again, we need to regroup, so we write 14 as 1*8 + 6, where the 1 carries over to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the 64's place digit, which is 0 for both numbers. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }_{1}^{ }\\\\\n&\\underline{\\phantom{ }67}\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }+\\underline{\\phantom{ }75}\\\\\n&142\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 67+75 in base-8 is $\\boxed{142}$.

We also need to add the carried-over 1 from the previous step. 7+7+1=15, but since we are in base-8, we need to regroup and write 15 as 1*8+7.

To add 73 and 37 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which gives us 3+7=12. However, in base-8, we only have digits up to 7, so we need to regroup. We can regroup by carrying over 1 to the eights place, and writing down the remainder of 12 when divided by 8, which is 4. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 7 and 3 (since we carried over 1 from the ones place). This gives us 7+3+1=11. Again, we need to regroup, so we carry over 1 to the next place value, and write down the remainder of 11 when divided by 8, which is 3. \n\nFinally, we have no more place values to add, so we can write down our answer as 110 in base-8. \n\nTherefore, 73+37=110 in base-8, or $\\boxed{110}$.

We also need to add any carry-over from the previous column, which is 1 (since 7+6=13, and 13 in base-8 is written as "15"). So we have 7+7+1=15 in base-8, which is written as "23" (since 2 eights and 3 ones make 15). \n\nTherefore, 77+26 in base-8 is equal to "2305". \n\n\\boxed{2305}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 43 and 51 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which are 3 and 1. This gives us 4, which we write down as the ones place digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move on to the eights place digits, which are 4 and 5. Adding these together gives us 11 in base-8. However, since we are working in base-8, we can only use digits 0-7. Therefore, we need to "carry over" one eight to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over eight to the next place value, which is the 64s place. The 64s place digits are 0 and 1 (from the carried-over eight).

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 76+24? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 76 and 24 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which gives us 6+4=12. Since 12 is greater than 7, we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which gives us 7+2+1=10. Again, we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down the 0 and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the 64s place digit, which gives us 1+1=2. We write down the 2. \n\nTherefore, 76+24=102 in base-8. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 63+72? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 63 and 72 in base-8, we first write out the numbers with leading zeros to make them the same length:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n63_8 &= 000\\,110\\,011_2 \\\\\n72_8 &= 000\\,111\\,010_2\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, we can add the digits in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{=} \\underline{000} \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} 1\\,\\underline{1}0\\,\\underline{1} \\\\\n&000\\,110\\,011_2 \\\\\n+ &000\\,111\\,010_2 \\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n&001\\,101\\,101_2\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we convert the result back to base-8:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n001\\,101\\,101_2 &= 015\\,015_8 \\\\\n\\boxed{015\\,015_8}\n\\end{align*}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 47+37? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 47 and 37 in base-8, we can start by adding the ones place digits, which gives us 7+7=16. However, since we are in base-8, we need to regroup any values greater than or equal to 8. In this case, we can regroup the 16 as 1 group of 8 and 6 ones. So, we write down the 6 in the ones place and carry the 1 over to the eights place. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which gives us 4+3+1=8. Again, we need to regroup any values greater than or equal to 8, so we can regroup the 8 as 1 group of 8 and 0 ones. So, we write down the 0 in the eights place and carry the 1 over to the sixty-fours place.\n\nSince there are no sixty-fours place digits to add, we can simply write down the carried-over 1 in the sixty-fours place. \n\nTherefore, 47+37= \\boxed{116} in base-8.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 52+16? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 52 and 16 in base-8, we first write out the numbers with leading zeros to make them the same length:\n\n52 = 064\n16 = 020\n\nThen we can add the digits in each place value, carrying over to the next place value if necessary:\n\n  0 6 4\n+ 0 2 0\n-------\n  1 0 4\n\nSo 52+16 in base-8 is equal to 104.

To add 72 and 37 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which are 2 and 7. 2+7=11 in base-8, but since we are limited to one digit, we carry over the extra 1 to the eights place. \n\nNext, we add the eights place digits, which are 7 and 3 (carrying over the 1 from the ones place). 7+3+1=11 in base-8, but again we are limited to one digit, so we carry over the extra 1 to the sixty-fours place.\n\nFinally, we add the sixty-fours place digits, which are 0 and 1 (carried over from the eights place). 0+1=1.\n\nTherefore, 72+37=111 in base-8. \n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 77 and 73 in base-8, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 7. 7+3=12, but since we are in base-8, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are both 7.

To add 62 and 47 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which gives us 2+7=11. Since 11 is greater than 7, we carry over the 1 to the eights place. In the eights place, we have 6+4+1=11. Again, we carry over the 1 to the next place value, which is the 64s place. In the 64s place, we have 1+1=2. Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{113}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 66+14? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 66 and 14 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 4. This gives us 12 in base-8. However, 12 is not a valid digit in base-8, so we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-8, carrying over happens when the sum of two digits is 8 or greater. \n\nIn this case, we carry over 1 to the next digit, and write down the remainder 2 in the current digit. Then we add the carried over 1 to the next digit, which gives us 7+1=10 in base-8. Again, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit, and write down the remainder 2 in the current digit. Finally, we add the carried over 1 to the leftmost digit, which gives us 1+1=2 in base-8. \n\nTherefore, 66+14=102 in base-8. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 24 and 54 in base-8, we first add the ones place digits, which are 4 and 4. This gives us 8, which is equal to 1 ten and 0 ones in base-8. We write down the 0 ones and carry the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens place digits, which are 2 and 5, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 10, which is equal to 1 hundred and 2 tens in base-8. We write down the 2 tens and carry the 1 hundred to the next column. \n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carried-over 1 hundred. \n\nTherefore, 24+54 in base-8 is equal to \\boxed{126}.

To add 55 and 16 in base-8, we first write out the numbers:\n\n55 = 65_8 (5 eights plus 5 ones)\n16 = 20_8 (2 eights plus 0 ones)\n\nNext, we line up the digits by place value:\n\n  65_8\n+ 20_8\n------\n  ??_8\n\nStarting with the ones place, we see that 5+6=13, which is greater than 7 (the largest digit in base-8). So we need to "carry" one over to the eights place:\n\n  65_8\n+ 20_8\n------\n  07_8\n  1\n\nNow we add the digits in the eights place, along with the "carry" of 1:\n\n  1\n  65_8\n+ 20_8\n------\n  07_8\n  1  (carry)\n\n1+1+5 = 7, so we write a 7 in the eights place and carry over another 1:\n\n  1\n  65_8\n+ 20_8\n------\n  47_8\n  1  (carry)\n\nFinally, we add the digit in the highest place value (the sixty-fours place), along with the carry of 1:\n\n  1\n  65_8\n+ 20_8\n------\n  47_8\n1 1  (carry)\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we can write our final answer:\n\n55+16 = 71_8 = \\boxed{61}_{10} (6 eights plus 1 one equals 49 plus 1 equals 50, plus another 11 equals 61 in base-10).
