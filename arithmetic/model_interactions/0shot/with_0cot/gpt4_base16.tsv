You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is EC+DD? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the digits in the ones place: C + D. Since C is 12 in base-10 and D is 13 in base-10, we have 12 + 13 = 25 in base-10. Since 25 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0, we write 25 as 19 in base-16. So, we carry over the 1 to the next place.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the sixteens place, along with the carry-over: E + D + 1. Since E is 14 in base-10 and D is 13 in base-10, we have 14 + 13 + 1 = 28 in base-10. Since 28 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + C * 16^0, we write 28 as 1C in base-16.\n\nPutting the results together, we have EC + DD = 1C19 in base-16.\n\nSo, the final result is \\boxed{1C19}.

First, let's break down the numbers 18 and 9F into their place values in base-16.\n\n18 = (1 \xd7 16^1) + (8 \xd7 16^0) = 16 + 8\n9F = (9 \xd7 16^1) + (F \xd7 16^0) = 144 + 15\n\nNow, let's add the numbers:\n\n16 + 8 + 144 + 15 = 183\n\nNow, let's convert 183 back into base-16:\n\n183 \xf7 16 = 11 remainder 7\n11 \xf7 16 = 0 remainder 11\n\nSo, 183 in base-16 is B7.\n\nTherefore, 18 + 9F = \\boxed{B7}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: 9 + B. Since B in base-16 represents 11 in base-10, we have 9 + 11 = 20 in base-10. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14, so we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: 7 + 8 + 1. In base-10, this is 7 + 8 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10.\n\nSo, the sum of 79 and 8B in base-16 is 104. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{104}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 7.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: 5 + D. In base-10, this is 5 + 13, which equals 18. Since 18 in base-16 is represented as 12, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the result, obtaining 1 + 2, which is 3 in both base-10 and base-16.\n\nSo, the sum of 54 and D3 in base-16 is \\boxed{327}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the ones place: 8 + 4 = 12. Since we are in base-16, 12 is represented by the digit "C". So, we have a "C" in the ones place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the sixteens place: A + F. In base-16, A represents 10 and F represents 15. So, 10 + 15 = 25. Since 25 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nTo find the digit that represents 25 in base-16, we can divide 25 by 16: 25 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 9. So, we have a "1" in the 256's place and a "9" in the sixteens place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the 256's place, 9 in the sixteens place, and C in the ones place.

In base-16, the number 53 is equal to (5 * 16^1) + (3 * 16^0) = 80 + 3 = 83 in base-10. The number C2 is equal to (12 * 16^1) + (2 * 16^0) = 192 + 2 = 194 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two base-10 numbers: 83 + 194 = 277.\n\nNow we need to convert the result back to base-16. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 277 by 16 and find the quotient and remainder: 277 \xf7 16 = 17 with a remainder of 5. The remainder, 5, is the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in the base-16 representation.\n\n2. Divide the quotient, 17, by 16 again: 17 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 1. The remainder, 1, is the next digit to the left in the base-16 representation.\n\n3. Since the quotient is now 1, which is less than 16, we have reached the most significant digit (leftmost digit) in the base-16 representation, which is 1.\n\nSo, the base-16 representation of the sum is 115. Therefore, 53 + C2 in base-16 is \\boxed{115}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is D.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digits: F (which is 15 in base-10) and 8.\n\n15 + 8 = 23. Since 23 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over.\n\n23 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0, which is 17 in base-16.\n\nSo, the sum is 17D in base-16.\n\nTherefore, FA + 83 in base-16 is \\boxed{17D}.

In base-16, 19 is represented as 13 (1*16^1) + 3 (3*16^0), so we write down 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: 6 + 6 + 1 (the carry-over) = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented as D.\n\nSo, the result is D3. Therefore, the sum is \\boxed{D3}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 23 is represented as 17, so we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: 9 + 8 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12.\n\nSo, the final result is 127. In base-16 notation, we write this as \\boxed{127}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since C represents 12, this is equivalent to 0 + 12, which is 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, we write C in the rightmost column of the result.\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have 1 + 2, which is 3. So, we write 3 in the next column of the result.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n```\n  10\n+ 2C\n-----\n  3C\n```\n\nSo, 10 + 2C in base-16 is \\boxed{3C}.

Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, 0 + F = F.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: C + A. In base-10, C is equivalent to 12 and A is equivalent to 10. So, 12 + 10 = 22 in base-10. To convert 22 back to base-16, we have 22 = (1 \xd7 16\xb9) + (6 \xd7 16\u2070), which means 22 in base-16 is 16.\n\nSo, the sum of C0 and AF in base-16 is 16F.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{16F}.

Since this is base-16, we have:\n\n2 + 7 = 9\n\nNow let's move to the next digits: C + 4. We need to convert these to decimal to add them:\n\nC in decimal is 12, and 4 is the same in both bases. So we have:\n\n12 + 4 = 16\n\nSince we are in base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So we have:\n\nC2 + 47 = 109\n\nThus, the result is \\boxed{109}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

The remainder (6) is the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in the base-16 representation.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (17) by 16: 17 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 1. The remainder (1) is the next least significant digit in the base-16 representation.\n\n3. The quotient (1) is less than 16, so it becomes the most significant digit (leftmost digit) in the base-16 representation.\n\nPutting these digits together, we get the base-16 representation of the result: 116.\n\nSo, 37 + DF in base-16 is \\boxed{116}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 69 and BB into their base-10 equivalents.\n\nFor 69:\n6 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0 = 96 + 9 = 105\n\nFor BB:\n11 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0 = 176 + 11 = 187\n\nNow, let's add these two base-10 numbers together:\n105 + 187 = 292\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-16. To do this, we'll divide 292 by 16 and find the remainder.\n\n292 \xf7 16 = 18 with a remainder of 4\n\nNow, we'll divide the quotient (18) by 16 again:\n18 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 2\n\nSo, the base-16 representation of 292 is 124.\n\nTherefore, 69 + BB in base-16 is \\boxed{124}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A4 and C9 in base-16, we'll start by adding the rightmost digits, 4 and 9.\n\n4 + 9 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to D in base-16. So, we write down D and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, A and C, along with the carry-over 1.\n\nA (which is 10 in base-10) + C (which is 12 in base-10) + 1 = 10 + 12 + 1 = 23 in base-10.\n\n23 in base-10 is equal to 17 in base-16, which is written as 1E.\n\nSo, A4 + C9 = 1ED in base-16.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1ED}.

Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 2 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digits: 7 + E. In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10. So, we have 7 + 14 = 21. To represent 21 in base-16, we need to find how many times 16 goes into 21 and what the remainder is. Since 16 goes into 21 once with a remainder of 5, we have 21 in base-16 as 15.\n\nSo, the sum of 7D and E2 in base-16 is 15F.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{15F}.

In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0, which is 19.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the sixteens place: 7 + 1. Their sum is 8.\n\nFinally, let's combine the results: 8*16^1 + 19*16^0, which is 8*16 + 19. In base-16, this is represented as 89.\n\nSo, 7D + 1C in base-16 is \\boxed{89}.

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is E.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: E + D. In base-10, E is equivalent to 14 and D is equivalent to 13. So, we have 14 + 13 = 27. To represent 27 in base-16, we can think of it as 1 * 16^1 + B * 16^0, since 1 * 16 + 11 = 27. Therefore, the leftmost digits of the sum are 1B.\n\nPutting the left and right parts together, we get the sum ED + D1 = 1BE. So, the result is \\boxed{1BE}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: F + A. Since F is 15 and A is 10 in base-16, we have 15 + 10 = 25. Since 25 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 9 (25 - 16) and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: F + B + 1. Since F is 15 and B is 11 in base-16, we have 15 + 11 + 1 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. However, there is no next column, so we simply write down 1 (27 - 16).\n\nPutting the two results together, we have 1 and 9, which gives us the final result of \\boxed{199}.

In base-16, 20 is represented as 14, so we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the leftmost digits: C + E + the carry-over 1. In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 and E is equivalent to 14. So we have 12 + 14 + 1 = 27. In base-16, 27 is represented as 1B.\n\nSo, the sum of CA and EA in base-16 is \\boxed{1B4}.

A is equivalent to 10 and C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, so we have 10 + 12 + 1 = 23.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 7E+13? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: E + 3. Since E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 3 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11, so we write down 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the next digits along with the carry-over: 7 + 1 + 1 (carry-over).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A4 and BA in base-16, we'll proceed column by column, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column (the 1s place): 4 + A. Since A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 4 + 10 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, we write down E and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. Move to the next column (the 16s place): 1 (carried over) + A + B. In base-10, this is 1 + 10 + 11 = 22. To represent 22 in base-16, we divide 22 by 16, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 6. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. Since there are no more digits in the original numbers, we just write down the carried-over 1 in the next column (the 256s place).\n\nSo, the result of A4 + BA in base-16 is 16E.

So, we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the sixteens place, along with the carry-over: 2 + 4 + 1. In base-10, this is 2 + 4 + 1 = 7.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the final result: \\boxed{77}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers AE and AA in base-16, we start by adding the rightmost digits:\n\nE + A\n\nSince E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10 and A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have:\n\n14 + 10 = 24\n\nSince 24 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over the 1. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1*16^1 + 8*16^0). So, we write down the 8 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + A + A\n\nRecall that A is equivalent to 10 in base-10:\n\n1 + 10 + 10 = 21\n\nIn base-16, 21 is represented as 15 (1*16^1 + 5*16^0).\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n15 (leftmost digits) and 8 (rightmost digits)\n\nTherefore, AE + AA in base-16 is:\n\n\\boxed{158}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add B3 and B9 in base-16, we can follow the same process as in base-10 addition, but we need to carry over when the sum exceeds 15 (F in base-16).\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (3 and 9)\n3 + 9 = 12 in base-10, which is C in base-16.\n\nStep 2: Add the leftmost digits (B and B) and carry over if necessary\nB in base-16 is 11 in base-10. So, 11 + 11 = 22 in base-10. Since 22 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 22 - 16 = 6 in base-10, which is 6 in base-16. So, we carry over 1 and write down 6.\n\nThe final result is 16C.

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is "C".\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: D + F. In base-16, D corresponds to 13 and F corresponds to 15. So, 13 + 15 = 28. Since we are in base-16, we need to convert 28 back to base-16 notation. 28 divided by 16 is 1 with a remainder of 12. So, 28 in base-16 is "1C".\n\nThus, the sum of D9 and F3 in base-16 is \\boxed{1CC}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 23 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 7 (23 - 16) and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 2 + 6 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, the result is 97. Therefore, 2F + 68 in base-16 is \\boxed{97}.

First, let's break down the numbers 30 and 4B into their place values in base-16.\n\n30 = (3 * 16^1) + (0 * 16^0) = 48 + 0 = 48\n4B = (4 * 16^1) + (11 * 16^0) = 64 + 11 = 75\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers together:\n\n48 + 75 = 123\n\nNow, we need to convert 123 back into base-16. To do this, we'll divide by the highest power of 16 that is less than 123 and find the remainder:\n\n123 \xf7 16 = 7 remainder 11\n\nSo, in base-16, 123 can be represented as:\n\n(7 * 16^1) + (11 * 16^0) = 7B\n\nTherefore, 30 + 4B = \\boxed{7B}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: F + 9. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 9 = 24. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1*16^1 + 8*16^0). So, we write down the 8 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 6 + 5 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C.\n\nSo, the final result is C8. Therefore, the sum is \\boxed{C8}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is C.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digits: F + 3. In base-16, F represents 15 in base-10. So, we have 15 + 3 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, which is the same as 1 * 16^1 + 2 * 16^0. So, we write down the digit 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nAdding the carried-over 1 to the next place, we have 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 12C. Therefore, FA + 32 in base-16 is \\boxed{12C}.

First, let's add the rightmost digits: 4 + 7 = 11 in base-10, which is B in base-16.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit. Since we have a carry-over from the previous step, we need to add 1 to the sum. So, F + 3 + 1 = 15 + 3 + 1 = 19 in base-10, which is 13 in base-16. So, the next digit is 3, and we have another carry-over.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over as the leftmost digit. So, the final result is 13B in base-16.\n\nTherefore, F4 + 37 in base-16 is \\boxed{13B}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the units digit of the sum is "C".\n\nNow, let's add the tens digits: 6 + 4 = 10. In base-16, 10 corresponds to the digit "A". So, the tens digit of the sum is "A".\n\nPutting the tens and units digits together, we get the sum 67 + 45 = AC.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{AC}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is C.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digits: 4 + E. In base-16, E represents the decimal number 14. So, we have 4 + 14 = 18. Since we are in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remainder, which is 2.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the result: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, the sum of 44 and E8 in base-16 is \\boxed{32C}.

Since B is 11 in base-10 and D is 13 in base-10, we have 11 + 13 = 24 in base-10. Since 24 in base-16 is 18 (1*16^1 + 8*16^0), we write down 8 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: F + 6 + 1. Since F is 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 6 + 1 = 22 in base-10. In base-16, 22 is 16 (1*16^1 + 6*16^0).\n\nSo, the sum of FB and 6D in base-16 is 168. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{168}.

In base-16, 23 is represented as 17, so we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: C + D + 1. In base-10, C is equivalent to 12 and D is equivalent to 13. So, we have 12 + 13 + 1 = 26. In base-16, 26 is represented as 1A.\n\nPutting the two parts together, we get the result: 1A7.

In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), so 22 in base-16 is 16. We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the next digits, considering the carry-over: 9 + 9 + 1. In base-10, this is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 1(16^1) + 3(16^0), so 19 in base-16 is 13.\n\nPutting the two results together, we have 13 in the left column and 6 in the right column, so the final result is 136.\n\nTherefore, 9E + 98 in base-16 is \\boxed{136}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: F + A. Since F is 15 and A is 10 in base-10, we have 15 + 10 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0, which is 19. So, we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: D + 9 + 1. Since D is 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 9 + 1 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0, which is 17.\n\nPutting the two parts together, we get the result: \\boxed{179}.

Since 2 + 4 = 6, we don't need to carry over any value.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: C + 5. In base-16, C represents the decimal value 12. So, 12 + 5 = 17. Since 16 is the base, we need to carry over the value 1 and write down the remainder 1 (which is represented by the digit 1 in base-16).\n\nSo, the final result is 116. Therefore, C2 + 54 in base-16 is \\boxed{116}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers AC and C6 in base-16, we'll start by adding the rightmost digits, C and 6.\n\nC in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10, and 6 in base-16 is equivalent to 6 in base-10. So, we have:\n\n12 + 6 = 18\n\nSince 18 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is equivalent to 12, so we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits, A and C, along with the carry-over 1.\n\nA in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and C in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So, we have:\n\n10 + 12 + 1 = 23\n\n23 in base-16 is equivalent to 17, so we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 172 in base-16.\n\nTherefore, AC + C6 in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{172}.

Since 19 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. 19 in base-16 is written as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: E + D + 1. In base-16, E represents 14 and D represents 13. So, 14 + 13 + 1 = 28. Since 28 is within the range of two-digit numbers in base-16, we don't need to carry over any more digits.\n\nSo, the final result is 283. Therefore, EA + D9 in base-16 is \\boxed{283}.

First, let's add the two numbers digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + B (which is 11 in base-10) = 18 in base-10. Since we are in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remainder, which is 2. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 2.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n1 (carried over) + B (11 in base-10) + 5 = 17 in base-10.

So, the rightmost digit of the result is F.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: D (13 in base-10) + 7 = 20 in base-10. To convert 20 to base-16, we have 1 group of 16 and 4 remaining, so it's 14 in base-16, which is E.\n\nSo, the result is EF in base-16.\n\n\\boxed{EF}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 8C+C3?

First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 + C (12 in base-10) = 15 in base-16, which is F. We don't need to carry over any digit since 15 is within the base-16 range.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n8 + C (12 in base-10) = 20 in base-10. Since 20 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over 1 to the next column (just like in base-10 addition). So, 20 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-16, which is E. \n\nSo, the final result is 1EF. Therefore, 8C + C3 = \\boxed{1EF}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, the number 18 represents 1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0 = 16 + 8 = 24 in base-10. The number C1 represents 12 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0 = 192 + 1 = 193 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two base-10 numbers: 24 + 193 = 217.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-16. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 217 by 16: 217 \xf7 16 = 13 with a remainder of 9. This means that there are 13 groups of 16 in 217, with 9 left over.\n2. Write down the remainder (9) as the rightmost digit of the base-16 number.\n3. Divide the quotient (13) by 16: 13 \xf7 16 = 0 with a remainder of 13. This means that there are 0 groups of 16^2 in 217, with 13 groups of 16^1 left over.\n4. Write down the remainder (13) as the leftmost digit of the base-16 number. Since 13 corresponds to the letter "D" in base-16, we write "D" as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the base-16 representation of 217 is D9.\n\nTherefore, 18 + C1 in base-16 is \\boxed{D9}.

So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 5 (from 59) + B (from B6). \n\nFirst, we need to convert B to its decimal equivalent. B in base-16 is equal to 11 in decimal. \n\nNow, we can add the numbers: 1 + 5 + 11 = 17. \n\nSince our result is greater than 15, we need to convert it back to base-16. 17 in decimal is equal to 11 in base-16, which is represented by B.\n\nSo, the final result is BF.\n\n\\boxed{BF}.

Since we are in base-16, we can represent 18 as 12 (1*16^1 + 2*16^0). So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: D (which is 13 in base-10), 7, and the carried-over 1.\n\n13 + 7 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 can be represented as 15 (1*16^1 + 5*16^0).\n\nSo, the final result is 152.\n\n\\boxed{152}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 237 by 16 and find the quotient and remainder: 237 \xf7 16 = 14 with a remainder of 13. So, 13 is the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in base-16.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (14) by 16 and find the quotient and remainder: 14 \xf7 16 = 0 with a remainder of 14. So, 14 is the next digit to the left in base-16.\n\nNow, we can write the base-16 number using the remainders we found: 14 is represented by the letter E, and 13 is represented by the letter D.\n\nSo, 43 + AA in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{ED}.

We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + D + 9. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 1 + 13 + 9 = 23 in base-10. In base-16, 23 is represented as 16 + 7, which is 1(16^1) + 7(16^0), so it is written as 17.\n\nPutting the two parts together, we get the result: \\boxed{176}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, we have 1 + 10 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B. So, we write down B and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + B + F. In base-16, B represents 11 and F represents 15. So, we have 1 + 11 + 15 = 27. In base-16, 27 can be represented as 1B (since 1 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0 = 27).\n\nSo, the sum of B1 and FA in base-16 is 1BB.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1BB}.

Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 7 + 14 = 21 in base-10. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0, which is 15. So, we write down 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the next digits, A and D, along with the carry-over 1. In base-10, A is 10 and D is 13. So, we have 10 + 13 + 1 = 24 in base-10.

In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F, and we carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 9 + C. Since C in base-16 represents 12 in base-10, we have 1 + 9 + 12 = 22. In base-16, 22 can be represented as 16 + 6, which is 1 \xd7 16^1 + 6 \xd7 16^0. So, the leftmost digits of the sum are 16.\n\nPutting the leftmost and rightmost digits together, we get the sum 95 + CA = 16F.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{16F}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers AB and AE in base-16, we start by adding the rightmost digits, B and E.\n\nB in base-10 is 11, and E in base-10 is 14. Adding them together, we get 11 + 14 = 25.\n\nSince 25 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 25 in base-16 is 19 (1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0). So, we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, A and A, along with the carry-over 1.\n\nA in base-10 is 10. Adding the two A's and the carry-over, we get 10 + 10 + 1 = 21.\n\n21 in base-16 is 15 (1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0).\n\nSo, the final result is 159. Therefore, AB + AE in base-16 is \\boxed{159}.

First, let's break down the numbers 6C and 9B into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n6C in base-16 means (6 * 16^1) + (12 * 16^0) = (6 * 16) + (12 * 1) = 96 + 12 = 108 in base-10.\n\n9B in base-16 means (9 * 16^1) + (11 * 16^0) = (9 * 16) + (11 * 1) = 144 + 11 = 155 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two base-10 numbers together: 108 + 155 = 263.\n\nNow, we need to convert 263 back into base-16. \n\nTo do this, we can divide 263 by 16 and find the remainder:\n\n263 \xf7 16 = 16 with a remainder of 7. So, the first digit (rightmost) in base-16 is 7.\n\nNow, we take the quotient (16) and divide it by 16 again:\n\n16 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 0. So, the second digit (leftmost) in base-16 is 1.\n\nPutting these digits together, we get the base-16 number 17.\n\nSo, 6C + 9B in base-16 is \\boxed{017}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In decimal, E represents the number 14, so we have 14 + 3 + 1 = 18. To represent 18 in base-16, we need to find how many sixteens are in 18. There is one 16 in 18, with a remainder of 2. So, we have a 1 in the thirty-twos place and a 2 in the sixteens place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the thirty-twos place, 2 in the sixteens place, and D in the ones place.

So, we write down 9:\n\n```\n  F9\n+10\n-----\n  9\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit. We have F + 1. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 1, which is 16. However, since we are in base-16, we need to represent 16 as 10 (similar to how we represent 10 in base-10 as 1 and 0).

We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 8 + 7 + 1. In base-10, this is 8 + 7 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 1(16^1) + 0(16^0), so 16 in base-16 is 10.\n\nPutting the two parts together, we get the final result: \\boxed{106}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, and B is equivalent to 11 in base-10. So, 14 + 11 = 25 in base-10.\n\nSince 25 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-16, 25 is equivalent to 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0, which is 19 in base-16.\n\nSo, E3 + B4 = 197 in base-16.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{197}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To do this, we'll divide by the highest power of 16 that is less than 211 and find the remainder:\n\n211 \xf7 16^1 = 211 \xf7 16 = 13 remainder 3\n\nSo, 211 in base-16 is D3 (since D represents 13 in base-16).

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit. We have C + A. In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 in decimal, and A is equivalent to 10 in decimal. So, 12 + 10 = 22 in decimal. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. \n\n22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, which is written as 16.

In base-10, F is 15 and E is 14, so we have 15 + 14 + 1 = 30 in base-10. To convert 30 back to base-16, we have 16 * 1 + 14, which is 1E in base-16.\n\nPutting the two parts together, we get the sum F7 + ED = 1E4 in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1E4}.

So, 2 + 9 = B (11 in base-10).\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: E + 4. Since E is 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 4 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 18 - 16 = 2, so we have a 2 in this position and carry over a 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result.

First, let's break down the numbers 42 and ED into their place values in base-16:\n\n42 = (4 * 16^1) + (2 * 16^0) = 64 + 2 = 66 in base-10\nED = (14 * 16^1) + (13 * 16^0) = 224 + 13 = 237 in base-10\n\nNow, let's add these base-10 numbers together:\n\n66 + 237 = 303\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-16:\n\n303 \xf7 16 = 18 R15, so we have F in the 16^0 place\n18 \xf7 16 = 1 R2, so we have 2 in the 16^1 place\n\nSo, 42 + ED in base-16 is \\boxed{2F}.

To add B0 and B4 in base-16, we can follow the same process as in base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15 (F in base-16).\n\nStarting with the least significant digit (rightmost digit), we have 0 + 4, which is 4. \n\nNow, moving to the next digit, we have B + B. In base-16, B is equivalent to 11 in base-10. So, we have 11 + 11, which is 22 in base-10. Since 22 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. \n\n22 in base-10 is equivalent to 16 + 6, which is 10 + 6 in base-16. So, we have a carry-over of 1 and a sum of 6 for this digit.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the carry-over of 1 and the sums of 6 and 4 for the two digits, giving us the final result of 164 in base-16.\n\nSo, B0 + B4 in base-16 is \\boxed{164}.

Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 0 + 13 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is D, and there is no carry-over.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: D + 4. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 4 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented by the number 11 (1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0). So, the leftmost digits of the sum are 11.\n\nPutting the leftmost and rightmost digits together, we get the sum D0 + 4D = 11D.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{11D}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is D.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: A + 5. Since A in base-16 represents 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 5 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is F.\n\nTherefore, the sum of AB and 52 in base-16 is FD. So, the result is \\boxed{FD}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 3E and 53 into their decimal equivalents. In base-16, the number 3E represents (3 * 16^1) + (14 * 16^0), since E is equivalent to 14 in decimal. So, 3E in decimal is (3 * 16) + 14 = 48 + 14 = 62.\n\nNow, let's break down the number 53 in base-16. This represents (5 * 16^1) + (3 * 16^0) = (5 * 16) + 3 = 80 + 3 = 83.\n\nNow, we need to add these decimal numbers together: 62 + 83 = 145.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the decimal number 145 back into base-16. To do this, we can divide 145 by 16 and find the remainder:\n\n145 \xf7 16 = 9 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the result in base-16 is 91. Therefore, 3E + 53 in base-16 is \\boxed{91}.

First, let's add the digits in the ones place: E + 7.\n\nE in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, so we have 14 + 7 = 21 in base-10. Since 21 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is 15 (F) plus 1, so we write down F and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the sixteens place, along with the carry-over: A + 5 + 1.\n\nA in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 in base-10. Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we have the carry-over 1 in the 256's place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the 256's place, 1 in the 16's place, and F in the 1's place.

First, let's add the digits in the ones place: C (which is 12 in base-10) and A (which is 10 in base-10). \n\n12 + 10 = 22 in base-10. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-10 is equal to 16 + 6, which is 1*16^1 + 6*16^0. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the sixteens place: 7, C (which is 12 in base-10), and the carried-over 1.\n\n7 + 12 + 1 = 20 in base-10. Since 20 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 20 in base-10 is equal to 1*16^1 + 4*16^0.

First, let's add the least significant digits (rightmost digits): E + 4.\n\nE in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, so we have 14 + 4 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. 18 in base-16 is written as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the next digits, considering the carry-over: 4 + C + 1.\n\n4 in base-16 is equivalent to 4 in base-10, and C in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So we have 4 + 12 + 1 = 17. 17 in base-16 is written as 11, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the carry-over.\n\nSo, the final result is 1122.\n\nTherefore, 4E + C4 in base-16 is \\boxed{1122}.

First, let's add the rightmost digits: A + C. \n\nA in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and C in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So, A + C = 10 + 12 = 22 in base-10. \n\nSince 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-10 is equivalent to 16 + 6, which is 1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0 in base-16. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 6, and we carry over 1 to the next place.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits and the carry-over: D + 6 + 1.\n\nD in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, and 6 in base-16 is equivalent to 6 in base-10.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the digits in the ones place: 4 + D. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 4 + 13 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11, so we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next place.\n\nNow let's add the digits in the sixteens place, along with the carry-over: 8 + A + 1. In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 8 + 10 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13.\n\nSo, the result of 84 + AD in base-16 is \\boxed{131}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the digits in the ones place: D + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14. Since we are in base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, we have a sum of E in the ones place and a carry-over of 1.\n\nNow, let's add the digits in the sixteens place, along with the carry-over: 1 + F + 1 = 1 + 15 + 1 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1(16) + 1, which means we have a 1 in the sixteens place and a carry-over of 1 to the next place.\n\nSo, the final sum is 1(256) + 1(16) + E(1) = 1(256) + 1(16) + 14(1) = 256 + 16 + 14 = 286. In base-16, 286 is represented as 11(16) + 6, which is written as B6.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 1D and F1 in base-16 is \\boxed{B6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since B in base-16 represents 11 in base-10, we have 11 + 9 = 20 in base-10. To convert 20 back to base-16, we have 20 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 4. So, 20 in base-16 is 14.\n\nPutting the results together, we have 146 as the sum of B4 and 92 in base-16.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{146}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 14 is represented by the letter E.\n\nSo, the result is EF. Therefore, the sum of 79 and 66 in base-16 is \\boxed{EF}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is C1+64? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: 1 + 4. Since these are both single-digit numbers in base-16, we can simply add them as we would in base-10: 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nNow, let's move to the next pair of digits: C + 6. In base-16, C represents the decimal number 12. So, we need to add 12 + 6, which equals 18. However, since we are working in base-16, we need to express 18 in base-16 notation. 18 in base-16 is represented as 12, which means 1 in the next place and 2 in the current place.\n\nSo, the final result is 1 in the next place, 2 in the current place, and 5 in the rightmost place. Therefore, C1 + 64 = \\boxed{125}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next place.\n\nSo, AE + 75 in base-16 is \\boxed{123}.

In base-16, 17 is represented as 11, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result:\n\n1 (carried over) + 1 (from the leftmost digits sum) = 2\n\nSo, the final result is 219.

So, the rightmost digit of the result is D.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: B (which is 11 in base-10) and 7.\n\n11 + 7 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. \n\n18 in base-16 is equal to 1*16^1 + 2*16^0, which is 12 in base-10. So, the leftmost digit of the result is 2, and we have a carry-over of 1.\n\nTaking the carry-over into account, the final result is 1*16^2 + 2*16^1 + D*16^0, which is equal to 1*256 + 2*16 + 13*1 = 256 + 32 + 13 = 301 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 301 back to base-16:\n\n301 = 1*16^2 + 2*16^1 + 13*16^0, which is equal to 12D in base-16.\n\nSo, BC + 71 = \\boxed{12D}.

First, let's add the two numbers in base-16:\n\n```\n  EF\n+ 64\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have F + 4. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 4 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the next digits, E and 6, along with the carry-over 1. In base-10, E is equivalent to 14, so we have 14 + 6 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 15, which is written as 5.\n\nSo, the result is 53 in base-16. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{53}.

First, let's break down the numbers 53 and EC into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n5 in base-16 is equal to 5 in base-10, and 3 in base-16 is equal to 3 in base-10. So, 53 in base-16 is equal to (5 * 16^1) + (3 * 16^0) = 80 + 3 = 83 in base-10.\n\nE in base-16 is equal to 14 in base-10, and C in base-16 is equal to 12 in base-10. So, EC in base-16 is equal to (14 * 16^1) + (12 * 16^0) = 224 + 12 = 236 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the base-10 equivalents: 83 + 236 = 319.\n\nFinally, let's convert the sum back to base-16. To do this, we'll divide 319 by 16 and find the remainder:\n\n319 \xf7 16 = 19 with a remainder of 15. So, the last digit is F (which corresponds to 15 in base-16).\n\nNow, we'll divide the quotient (19) by 16:\n\n19 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 3.

Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 1 + 12 + 4 = 17 in base-10. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11.\n\nSo, the result is 117 in base-16. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{117}.

Since 23 is greater than 15, we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17 (1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0).\n\nSo, we carry over the 1 and write down the 7 in the sixteens place.

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is B.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digits: F + 4. In base-16, F represents the decimal number 15. So, we have 15 + 4 = 19. To represent 19 in base-16, we need to find how many times 16 goes into 19 and what the remainder is. Since 16 goes into 19 one time with a remainder of 3, we can represent 19 as 1(16) + 3, or in base-16 notation, 13.\n\nSo, the sum of FA and 41 in base-16 is 13B.

Since 13 corresponds to the letter "D" in base-16, the first digit is D.\n\n8 \xf7 16 = 0 with a remainder of 8.

First, let's add the two numbers in base-16, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n2 + B\n\nSince B in base-16 represents 11 in base-10, we have:\n\n2 + 11 = 13\n\n13 in base-16 is represented by the digit D. So, we have D as the rightmost digit of the sum.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost digit:\n\nE + 4\n\nSince E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have:\n\n14 + 4 = 18\n\n18 in base-16 is represented by the number 12, which is written as 1(16^1) + 2(16^0). So, we have 1 as the carry-over digit and 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the sum E2 + 4B = 12D.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{12D}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is BE+E2? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers BE and E2 in base-16, we'll start by adding the least significant digits (rightmost digits) and then move to the left.\n\n1. Add the least significant digits: E + 2\n   E in base-16 is 14 in base-10, and 2 is the same in both bases.\n   So, 14 + 2 = 16 in base-10.\n   Since 16 is the base, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0.\n\n2. Add the next digits, including the carry-over: B + E + 1\n   B in base-16 is 11 in base-10, and E is 14 in base-10.\n   So, 11 + 14 + 1 = 26 in base-10.\n   To convert 26 to base-16, we'll divide by 16 and find the remainder.\n   26 \xf7 16 = 1 with a remainder of 10.\n   The remainder, 10, corresponds to the digit A in base-16.\n\nSo, the sum of BE and E2 in base-16 is 1A0.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1A0}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 6D+D9? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: D + 9. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 9 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), or 16 + 6. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits: 6 + D (which is 13) + the carry-over 1. This gives us 6 + 13 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 1(16^1) + 4(16^0), or 16 + 4.\n\nSo, the final result is 146 in base-16. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{146}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
