You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 76+14? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 76 and 14 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 4. Since 6+4=10, we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 7 and 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step). 7+1=8, so we write down 8 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 76+14=88 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{88}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 97+74? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 97 and 74 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 4. This gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in base-11. We write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 9 and 7 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the digit in the column). This gives us 16, which is equal to one group of 11 and 5 more. We write down the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit from the previous step) and 0. This gives us 1, which we write down.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ } \\\\\n&\\quad\\, 97 \\\\\n&\\quad\\,+74 \\\\\n&\\quad\\,--- \\\\\n&\\boxed{151} \\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 97+74 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{151}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 85+A3? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and A3 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 3. This gives us 8, which we write down as the units digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move on to the 11s digit. We add 8 (from the previous step) to 3 (the digit in the 11s place of A3) to get 11. However, since we are in base-11, we need to write this as 10A, where A represents the digit 10. We write down the A as the 11s digit of our answer, and carry the 1 to the 121s digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried 1 to the 8 in the 121s digit of 85. This gives us 9, which we write down as the 121s digit of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 85+A3 in base-11 is \\boxed{9A8}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 92 and 52 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 2. This gives us 4. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 92 and the 5 in 52. Adding these gives us 14, which is one group of 11 with 3 left over. We write down the 3 and carry the 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (from the carry) and 0.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 29 and 58 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 8. Since 9+8=17, we write down the digit 7 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 2 and 5, and add the carried-over digit of 1. 2+5+1=8, so we write down the digit 8 in the second column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 29+58=87 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{87}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A2 and 51, we first need to convert them both to base-10. \n\nA2 in base-11 is equal to 10*11^1 + 2*11^0 = 121 + 2 = 123 in base-10. \n\n51 in base-11 is equal to 5*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 55 + 1 = 56 in base-10. \n\nNow we can add them in base-10: \n\n123 + 56 = 179 \n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-11: \n\n179 in base-10 is equal to 16*11^1 + 3*11^0 = 163 + 3 = 16A in base-11. \n\nTherefore, A2 + 51 = \\boxed{16A}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 2A+67? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 2A and 67 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are A and 7. A + 7 = 11, which is equal to 10 in base-11, so we write down 0 and carry-over 1. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 1 and A (the carried-over 1 plus the next digit of 2A). 1 + A + 1 (the carried-over 1) = C (12 in base-11), so we write down 2 and carry-over 1 again. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 2 and 6 (the carried-over 1 plus the next digit of 67). 2 + 6 + 1 (the carried-over 1) = 9, so we write down 9. \n\nTherefore, 2A + 67 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{29C}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 91+66? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 91 and 66 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 6. This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 91 and the 6 in 66. Adding these gives us 15, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNow we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit, which is the 1 in 91 and the 6 in 66, as well as the 1 from the carry-over. This gives us 9+6+1=16, which is also greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over another 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is the 9 in 91 and the 6 in 66, as well as the 1 from the previous carry-over. This gives us 9+6+1=16, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over another 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we can write the final result as \\boxed{181}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 69 and 48 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 8. Since 9+8=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n9+8=17, which becomes 6 with a carry-over of 1.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 1 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n1+4+1=6.\n\nTherefore, 69+48=116 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{116}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in base-11. We write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 9, and add the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us 18, which is equal to one group of 11 and 7. We write down the digit 7 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 1, and add the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us 2. We write down the digit 2.\n\nTherefore, 87+94 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{172}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

A + 9 = 13, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the carry-over digit (1) to the next digit of 7A, which is 7. 1 + 7 = 8. \n\nFinally, we add the remaining digits of 7A, which is just A. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  7A\n+ 19\n---\n  8B\n\nTherefore, 7A + 19 = \\boxed{8B} in base-11.

This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 8 and 4, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 13, which is equal to B in base-11. We write down the B and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just 1, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 2, which is equal to 2 in base-11. We write down the 2.\n\nTherefore, 85+45 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{B2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 6. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is A. We need to carry over the 1 from the previous step, so we add 1 to A, which gives us B. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 2 and 0 (since we already carried over the 1 from the previous step). This gives us 2. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n23\n+A3\n---\nB62\n\nTherefore, 23+A3 in base-11 is \\boxed{B62}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 42 and 97 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 7. This gives us 9, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right. We have a 4 and a 9, but we also need to add the "carry" from the previous step, which is 1 (since 2+7=9, and 9+4+1=14). So we have 4+9+1=14, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11. We write down the A as the next digit in our answer, and carry the 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (the carry from the previous step) and 0. This gives us 1, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\boxed{A1}\n\nSo 42+97 in base-11 is equivalent to A1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 81 and 58 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 8. Since 1+8=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1 in 81 and the 5 in 58. Since 1+5=6, we write down 6 as the next digit of the sum, to the left of the 9 we just wrote down. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are the 8 in 81 and the 0 in 58 (since we've run out of digits to the left). 8+0=8, so we write down 8 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n81\n+58\n---\n  9 6 8\n\nTherefore, 81+58= \\boxed{968} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 51 and 95 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 5. This gives us 6. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 5 and 9, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). This gives us 14. However, since we are in base-11, we need to write 14 as "A4", where the "A" represents the digit 10. \n\nTherefore, 51+95 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{A6}.

To solve this problem, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding values in base-10. \n\nA = 10 \n\nSo, 93+A8 becomes: \n\n9*11^2 + 3*11^1 + 10*11^0 + A*11^(-1) + 8*11^(-2) \n\n= 9*121 + 3*11 + 10*1 + 10/11 + 8/121 \n\n= 1089 + 33 + 10 + 0.909 + 0.066 \n\n= 1132.975 \n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, we get: \n\n\\boxed{1132.98}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 5, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is A and 8. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we add 10 and 8 to get 18. However, 18 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry over" the extra 1 to the next digit. We write down the digit 8 as the next digit in our answer, and carry over the 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit, which is A and 0. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we add 10 and 1 to get 11. We write down the digit 1 as the next digit in our answer, and we're done! \n\nTherefore, A4+81 in base-11 is \\boxed{188}.

To add A6 and 69 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 9. \n\n6 + 9 = F (since F is the digit that comes after 9 in base-11)\n\nSo, we write down the digit F and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are A and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous column. \n\nA + 6 + 1 = 11\n\nSince 11 is two digits in base-11, we write down the rightmost digit (which is 1) and carry-over the leftmost digit (which is 1) to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (from the carry-over). \n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{1F1}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert AA to base-10 to add it to 30. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so AA represents 11*10 + 10 = 120. \n\nNow we can add 30 and 120 in base-10: \n\n30 + 120 = 150 \n\nFinally, we need to convert 150 back to base-11. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 150 is 11^2 = 121, which fits into 150 once with a remainder of 29. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 29 is 11^1 = 11, which fits into 29 twice with a remainder of 7. \n\nTherefore, 30+AA in base-11 is \\boxed{127}.

Since A represents 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. \n\n- A + 8 = 12, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11.

We write down the A and carry-over the 1.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digit, which is the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n- 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, 9A+78 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1A1}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add AA and 63, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 63\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the units digits (A and 3), which gives us 13. However, in base-11, we can't write 13 as "13" - we need to carry over to the next digit. Specifically, 13 in base-11 is written as "12" (since we don't have a symbol for "13" - we use "A" to represent 10). So we write down the "2" in the units place, and carry over the "1" to the next digit:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 63\n---\n   2\n```\n\nNow we need to add the "1" we carried over to the next digit, to the next digit of AA. The next digit of AA is another "A", which is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So we add 1 and 10, which gives us 11. However, in base-11, we can't write 11 as "11" - we need to carry over to the next digit. Specifically, 11 in base-11 is written as "10" (since we don't have a symbol for "11" - we use "A" to represent 10). So we write down the "0" in the next digit, and carry over the "1" to the next digit:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 63\n---\n  20\n```\n\nNow we need to add the "1" we carried over to the next digit, to the next digit of AA. The next digit of AA is another "A", which is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So we add 1 and 10, which gives us 11. However, in base-11, we can't write 11 as "11" - we need to carry over to the next digit. Specifically, 11 in base-11 is written as "10" (since we don't have a symbol for "11" - we use "A" to represent 10). So we write down the "0" in the next digit, and carry over the "1" to the next digit:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 63\n---\n 220\n```\n\nSo AA+63 in base-11 is equal to 220. Therefore, $\\boxed{220}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 45+35? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 45 and 35 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 5. This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 4 and 3, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 8. We write down the 8 and do not need to carry-over anything to the next column. \n\nTherefore, 45+35 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{8A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 40+AA? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to determine the value of "AA" in base-10. In base-11, "A" represents the value of 10. Therefore, "AA" in base-11 is equivalent to 11 times the value of "A" plus the value of "A" itself, which is 11 times 10 plus 10, or 120.\n\nNext, we can add 40 and 120 in base-10, which gives us 160.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 160 back into base-11. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 160 is 11^2, which is 121. Therefore, we have one "1" in the 11^2 place. The remainder is 160 - 121 = 39. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 39 is 11^1, which is 11. Therefore, we have three "6"s in the 11^1 place. The remainder is 39 - 33 = 6. Therefore, we have six "6"s in the 11^0 place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n40 + AA = 40 + 120 = 160 = \\boxed{1666A} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 99 and 20 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 0. Since 9+0=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. We add 9 (from 99) and 2 (from 20), which gives us 11. However, in base-11, we don't have a digit for 11, so we need to carry over to the next digit. 11 in base-11 is represented as "A", so we write down "A" as the second digit from the right in the sum. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 99 and 20 in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{A9}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A1 and 71 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 71\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding 1 and A (which is equivalent to 10 in base-10):\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 71\n---\n  12\n```\n\nNext, we add 1 and 7:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 71\n---\n  82\n```\n\nTherefore, A1+71 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{82}.

In base-11, 1+9=A, so we write down A as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since A represents 11 in base-10) to the digits in the 10's place: 6+1+9=10. In base-11, 10 is represented by the digit A, so we write down A as the digit in the 10's place of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 61+19=AA in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{AA}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. \n\n3 + A = D (in base-11)\n\nNext, we add the carry-over (1) to the tens digit (8).\n\n1 + 8 = 9\n\nTherefore, 83 + 1A = 9D in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{9D}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 8+9=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 7 (the ones digit of 17) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 1 and 7 (the digit we carried over plus the next digit in each number). 1+7=8, so we write down 8 in the next digit place.\n\nTherefore, 18+79=97 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{97}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 2+8=10, we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 7 and 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step). 7+1=8, so we write down 8 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 72+18=80 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{80}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 80 and A1 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n  80\n+ A1\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that 1 + 0 = 1, so we write down 1 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ A1\n---\n  1\n```\n\nNext, we add the 8 and A. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next place value:\n\n```\n  80\n+ A1\n---\n  1B\n```\n\nTherefore, 80+A1 in base-11 is equal to $\\boxed{1B}$.

To add 73 and 55 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 5. \n\n3 + 5 = 8 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 8. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 7 and 5, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). \n\n7 + 5 + 0 = 12 \n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 1A (1 ten and A ones). So the digit in the 10's place of our answer is A. \n\nPutting it all together, we have: \n\n 73\n+55\n---\n  A8\n\nTherefore, 73+55= \\boxed{A8} in base-11.

First, we need to remember the values of the digits in base-11: \n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A (where A represents the value 10). \n\nNext, we can add the digits in the ones place: 9 + A = 13. \n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to regroup when the sum is greater than or equal to 11. In this case, we can regroup 13 as 11 + 2. \n\nThe 2 goes in the ones place, and we carry the 1 over to the tens place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place: 1 + 8 = 9. \n\nSo the final result is 29A in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{29A}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 8A and 79 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits in their respective columns:\n\n```\n  8 A\n+ 7 9\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we add 9 and A, which gives us 13.

These add up to 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 9 and 6 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step is included).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to understand the base-11 number system. In base-11, each digit represents a power of 11. The rightmost digit represents 11^0 (which is 1), the next digit to the left represents 11^1 (which is 11), the next digit to the left represents 11^2 (which is 121), and so on.\n\nSo, let's break down the number 20+A3 in base-11:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 3, which represents 3*11^0 = 3*1 = 3.\n- The next digit to the left is A, which represents 10*11^1 = 110.\n- The next digit to the left is 0, which represents 0*11^2 = 0.\n- The leftmost digit is 2, which represents 2*11^3 = 2*1331 = 2662.\n\nNow, we can add up these values to get the final result:\n\n20+A3 = 2662 + 0 + 110 + 3 = 2775\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2775}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 52 and 88 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 8. This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 5 and 8, and add the carried-over 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 88 and A0 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n  88\n+ A0\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that the rightmost digit of the sum is 0, since 8 + 0 = 8. We write down the 0 and carry the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  88\n+ A0\n---\n  0 \n```\n\nIn the next column, we have 1 + 0 + A = B (remember that A represents the digit 10 in base-11). So we write down B and carry the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  88\n+ A0\n---\n  B0 \n```\n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we have 1 + 8 = 9. So we write down 9:\n\n```\n  88\n+ A0\n---\n  B9 \n```\n\nTherefore, 88+A0 in base-11 is \\boxed{B9}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 17 and 64 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 4. This gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in base-11. We write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 6. This gives us 7. We write down the digit 7 in the second column from the right.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carry-over) and 1. This gives us 1. We write down the digit 1 in the third column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 17+64 in base-11 is equal to 81. \n\n\\boxed{81}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 1A (1 ten and A units). \n\nNext, we add the tens column, which gives us 9+2=11. Again, we need to regroup this as 1A. \n\nFinally, we add the regrouped values from the units and tens columns, which gives us 1+1+A=10+A. \n\nTherefore, 99+23=1A1\\boxed{0}.

This gives us 13, which is equal to 1 ten and 3 ones. We write down the 3 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 2 and 4, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 7. We write down the 7 in the second column from the right.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step). This gives us 1, which we write down in the third column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 29+44=73 in base-11, which we write as \\boxed{73}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 7A and 20 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  7A\n+ 20\n----\n```\n\nSince A represents the value 10 in base-10, we can rewrite the problem as:\n\n```\n  7 10\n+ 2  0\n------\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 0 and 10, which gives us 10 in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  7 10\n+ 2  0\n------\n     0\n```\n\nMoving to the next digit, we add 1 (the carried digit) to 7 and 2, which gives us 10 again. We write down the 0 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n  7 10\n+ 2  0\n------\n    10\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carried 1 to the leftmost digit, which gives us 8:\n\n```\n  7 10\n+ 2  0\n------\n  8  10\n```\n\nTherefore, 7A+20 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{810}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 3A and 9A, we can start by adding the units digits, which are A and A. A + A = 14, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. So we have 4 in the units place and 1 in the elevens place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 3 and 9, and we add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. 3 + 9 + 1 = 13, but again, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. So we have 3 in the elevens place and 1 in the one-hundred-and-twenty-ones place. \n\nTherefore, 3A + 9A = 11(1) + 11(3) + 4 = 11(4) + 4 = 48. \n\n\\boxed{48}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 98 and 57 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 7. \n\n8 + 7 = 15 \n\nSince 15 is greater than 10 (represented by the digit A), we need to carry over to the next digit. We can do this by dividing 15 by 11 and taking the remainder: \n\n15 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 4 \n\nSo the digit in the ones place is 4, and we carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 9 and 5 (remembering to add the carried-over 1): \n\n9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit: \n\n15 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 4 \n\nSo the digit in the elevens place is 4, and we carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0 (plus the carried-over 1): \n\n0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \n\nSo the final result is: \n\n98 + 57 = \\boxed{141}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 89 and 46 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 6. Since 9+6=14, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 14 is one more than the largest digit A in base-11). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the left, which are 8 and 4 (plus the carried-over 1). 8+4+1=13, so we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 1 and 0 (plus the carried-over 1). 1+0+1=2, so we write down the digit 2. \n\nTherefore, 89+46=122 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{122}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 8, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digits from the right, which are 9 and 4. Adding these gives us 13, which is greater than 10 in base-11. So, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. In base-11, 13 is written as "BA", so we write down the "A" as the next digit in our answer and carry the "B" over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried over the "B" from the previous step). This gives us 1, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{A8B}\n\nTherefore, 97+41 in base-11 is A8B.

To add 23 and 86 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 6. \n\n3 + 6 = 9 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 9. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 1's place: \n\n2 + 8 + 0 = 10 \n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to regroup 10 as 1A (1 ten and A ones).

A + 8 = 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11, so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the carried-over 1. That is, we add 7 and 7 (the digits in the second position from the right). 7 + 7 + 1 (the carried-over 1) = F (15 in base-11).

To add 8A and 67 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits in the ones place:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 67\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that 7 + A = 11, which is equal to 10 in base-11. So we write down a 0 in the ones place and carry-over a 1 to the elevens place:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 67\n---\n   0\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, along with the carry-over from the ones place:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 67\n---\n  10\n```\n\nWe can see that 1 + A = B (which is equal to 12 in base-11), so we write down a B in the elevens place and carry-over a 1 to the 121s place:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 67\n---\n  B0\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digit in the 121s place, along with the carry-over from the elevens place:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ 67\n---\n  B0\n```\n\nSo the result is $\\boxed{B0}$ in base-11.

Again, 12 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we regroup. We can write 12 as 1A, where 1 is carried over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds column, which gives us 1+1=2. \n\nTherefore, 99+26=1A2 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{1A2}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 35 and 70 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 0. This gives us 5. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 3 and 7. Adding these gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. However, we cannot write A in the 1's place, so we carry over the 1 to the next digit, which is the 11's place. Here, we have 1 and 7. Adding these with the carried over 1 gives us 9.

To add A7 and 77 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 7 7\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding 7 and 7, which gives us 14. However, 14 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry over to the next column. 14 is equal to 1 ten and 4 ones in base-10, so we write down the 4 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 7 7\n-----\n  1 4\n```\n\nNext, we add the carried 1 to A and 7:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 7 7\n-----\n  1 4\n  8 A\n```\n\nFinally, we have to add 8 and A. A comes after 9 in base-11, so we can think of it as 10. Then, 8 + 10 = 18, which is equal to 1 ten and 8 ones in base-11. So we write down the 8 and carry the 1:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 7 7\n-----\n  1 4\n  8 A\n  1 8\n```\n\nTherefore, A7 + 77 = 18A in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{18A}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit, which is 1. Therefore, the units place is 4 and we carry-over 1 to the 11s place. \n\nNext, we add the 11s place, which is 6+2+1=9 in base-10.

A + 0 = A, so we write down A as the units digit of our result. Next, we add the 11s digit. 5 + 9 = E, but E is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry over to the next place value. Since 11 is represented by the digit A in base-11, we carry over 1A (which is 11 in base-10) to the next place value. Adding the 1A to the next place value gives us 1A + 0 = 1A.

Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 2 and 2 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the digit in the tens place). 2+2=4, so we write down the digit 4 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 24+28=42 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{42}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A2 and 86 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 6. Since 2+6=8, we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is A and 8. Since A represents the value 10 in base-11, we add 10 and 8 to get 18. However, 18 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry over" the extra 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we write down 8 as the second digit from the right of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 0. 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, A2+86=18A in base-11, which is equivalent to $\\boxed{212}$ in base-10.

We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 3 and 7. This gives us 10. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 1A (where A represents the digit 10). \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 11's place, which are 0 and 0.

Since 7+8=15, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n 47\n+68\n---\n 15  <- write down the rightmost digit of the sum\n```\n\nCarry over the 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n 47\n+68\n---\n 15\n  1  <- carry over\n```\n\nNow we add the next digits, which are 1 and 4, and add the carry-over:\n\n```\n 47\n+68\n---\n 15\n  1\n  6  <- 1+4+1=6\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 6:\n\n```\n 47\n+68\n---\n 15\n  1\n  6\n  A  <- 0+6=A (since A is the digit that represents 10 in base-11)\n```\n\nTherefore, 47+68=16A in base-11. \n\n$$\\boxed{16A}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  39\n +9A\n----\n  D9\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 0 (since A represents 10 and there is no digit in the tens place for 9A).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert AA to base-10 to add it to 85. In base-11, A represents 10, so AA represents 11*10 + 10 = 120. \n\nNow we can add 85 and 120 in base-10: \n\n85 + 120 = 205 \n\nFinally, we need to convert 205 back to base-11. \n\n205 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 18 with a remainder of 7. \n\n18 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 7. \n\nSo, 205 in base-11 is 17A. \n\nTherefore, 85+AA in base-11 is \\boxed{17A}.

Since 6+7=13, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n6\n+ 7\n---\n  D\n```\n\nWe write D as the rightmost digit of the result, and carry over 1 to the next digit. Now we need to add 1, 7, and A (which represents 10) together:\n\n```\n 1\n 1 7\n+ A\n----\n  C\n```\n\nWe write C as the next digit of the result, and carry over 1 to the next digit again. Finally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit:\n\n```\n 1\n 1 7\n+ A 7\n-----\n 1 8\n```\n\nTherefore, 76+A7 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{18}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 6+7=D (since A=10, B=11, and C=12). So we write down the digit D and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 8. In base-11, 1+8=9.

This gives us 4. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add 7, 8, and the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0). This gives us 15, which is written as "A5" in base-11. We write down the 5 and carry-over the "A" to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and the carry-over from the previous step (which is "A"). This gives us 12, which is written as "B2" in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 72+82 = \\boxed{B24} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 8. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 95 and the 3 in 33. Adding these gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, we have the 1 from the carry-over, the 5 from 95, and the 3 from 33.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 37 and 66 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=13, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 13 is one more than the largest digit A). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 3 and 6 (the digit 1 was carried over from the units place). 3+6+1=10, so we write down the digit A and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundred-and-ones place, which are 0 and 0 (the digit 1 was carried over from the elevens place). 0+0+1=1, so we write down the digit 1. \n\nTherefore, 37+66=102 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are both 7. We also add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. This gives us a total of 15, which is equal to 14 in base-11. We write down the 4 and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are both 0. We also add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. This gives us a total of 1, which is equal to 1 in base-11. We write down the 1.\n\nTherefore, 77+73 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{A41}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 47 and 49 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 9. \n\n7 + 9 = 16 \n\nSince 16 is greater than 10 (represented by the digit A in base-11), we need to carry over to the next place value. \n\nThe next place value is the 11's place, so we add 1 to the sum of the 11's digits: \n\n4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \n\nTherefore, 47 + 49 in base-11 is equal to 96: \n\n\\boxed{96}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding values in base-10. \n\nA = 10 \n\nSo, 33+A4 becomes: \n\n33 + 10(11) + 4 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n33 + 110 + 4 = 147 \n\nTherefore, the result is: \n\n\\boxed{147}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A1 and 94 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 94\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that 1 + 4 = 5, so we write down 5 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 94\n---\n   5\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the 11s place: A + 9 = 13. Since we are in base-11, we need to regroup 1 from the 13 and write down 2 in the 11s place:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 94\n---\n  25\n```\n\nTherefore, A1 + 94 = 25A in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{25A}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 66+80? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 66 and 80 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 0. This gives us 6. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 6+8=14. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup. 14 is equal to 1 ten and 4 ones, but we don't have a symbol for ten in our base-11 system. Instead, we write 14 as "A4", where A represents ten. We carry the ten over to the next digit, which is the 11's place. We have 1+1=2, so the final result is:\n\n66+80 = A42 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{A42}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 9A and 96 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are A and 6. A + 6 = 10, which is equal to A0 in base-11 (since we carry over 1 to the next digit). \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 9 and 9. 9 + 9 = 18, which is equal to 10A in base-11 (since we carry over 1 to the next digit). \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digit, which is 1 (from the carry-over). \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n9A + 96 = A0 + 10A + 1 = 11A + 1\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{11A+1}.

To add A7 and 84 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 8 4\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 4. In base-11, 7+4=10, which is represented by the digit A. We write down A in the result and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 8 4\n-----\n  1 A\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are A and 8, plus the carry-over of 1. In base-11, A+8+1=14, which is represented by the digits 1A. We write down the rightmost digit (A) in the result and carry-over the leftmost digit (1) to the next column:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 8 4\n-----\n  1 A\n  A\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over of 1. We write down 1 in the result:\n\n```\n A 7\n+ 8 4\n-----\n  1 A\n1 A\n-----\n  B B\n```\n\nTherefore, A7+84=BB in base-11, or $\\boxed{130}$ in base-10.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 83 and 64 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 4. Since 3+4=7, we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 83 and the 6 in 64. Since 8+6=14, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next digit. We write down the remainder of 14 when divided by 11, which is 3, as the second digit from the right in the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 1 in 83 and 0 in 64. 1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 83+64=247 in base-11, which we write as $\\boxed{247}$.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 60 and 5A in base-11, we start by adding the units digit. 0+0=0, so the units digit is 0. Next, we add the 11s digit. 6+5=11, but since we are in base-11, we need to regroup. 11 in base-10 is represented as "A" in base-11, so we carry over an "A" to the 11s digit. Finally, we have a result of A0, which is equivalent to 11*10+0=110 in base-10. Therefore, 60+5A = \\boxed{A0} in base-11, which is equivalent to 110 in base-10.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 49 and 78 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 8. Since 9+8=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 4 and 7, and add the carry-over from the previous step. 4+7+1=12, which is also greater than 10, so we carry over 1 to the next digit again. We write down 2 as the second digit from the right of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1, and add the carry-over from the previous step. 0+1+1=2, so we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nTherefore, 49+78=127 in base-11, which we write as \\boxed{127}.

To add 47 and 45 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 5. \n\n7 + 5 = C (since C is the digit that represents 12 in base-11)\n\nSo, we write down the digit C and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 4 and 4 (plus the carry-over of 1). \n\n4 + 4 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, we write down the digit 9 in the second column. \n\nTherefore, 47 + 45 = 9C in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{9C}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 11, which is equal to 1 ten and 1 one. We write down the 1 in the ones place and carry the 1 ten over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 4 and 6, and we add the carried-over ten from the previous step. This gives us 20, which is equal to 1 eleven and 9 ones. We write down the 9 in the tens place and carry the 1 eleven over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which is just the carried-over eleven from the previous step.

This gives us 8, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 8 and 1 (since A represents 10 in base-11). This gives us 9, but we also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which was 1.

We write down the "3" as the next digit of our answer, and carry-over the "A" (which represents 11 in base-10) to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, our final answer is "A3 9 6" in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 94+A8? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to remember the place values of each digit in base-11. Starting from the rightmost digit, the place values are 1, 11, 121, 1331, and so on. \n\nSo, 94+A8 can be written as:\n\n(9 x 121) + (4 x 11) + (10 x 1) + (8 x 1331)\n\n= 1089 + 44 + 10 + 10648\n\n= 11791\n\nTherefore, 94+A8 in base-11 is \\boxed{11791}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 44+88? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 44 and 88 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 4. This gives us 8. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the 1 from 44 to the 8 we just got, which gives us 9. \n\nMoving on to the next digit, which is the 11's place, we add the 8 from 44 to the 8 we got in the previous step. This gives us 10, which is written as "A" in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 44+88 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{A9}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A7+9A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A7 and 9A, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and A. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we can rewrite the problem as:\n\nA7\n+ 9A\n----\n  ???\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 7 + A = 11. In base-11, 11 is represented by the digit A0, so we write down the 0 and carry the 1 to the next column:\n\nA7\n+ 9A\n----\n  0A\n\nMoving to the next column, we have 1 + 7 + 9 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented by the digit 16, which we can break down as 1A (since 10 + 6 = 16). So we write down the A and carry the 1 to the next column:\n\nA7\n+ 9A\n----\n  A0A\n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we have 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. So we write down the 1:\n\nA7\n+ 9A\n----\n  A1A\n\nTherefore, A7+9A = \\boxed{A1A} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 29 and 22 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and 2. This gives us 11, which is equal to 1 ten and 1 unit. We write down the 1 unit and carry the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 2 and 2 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 5. \n\nTherefore, 29+22 in base-11 is equal to 51. \n\n\\boxed{51}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 73 and 44 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 4. \n\n3 + 4 = 7 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 1's place: \n\n7 + 4 + 0 = 11 \n\nSince we are in base-11, we can't write "11" as a digit. Instead, we write "A" to represent the value of 11 in this base. So the digit in the 1's place of our answer is "A". \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 11's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 11's place: \n\n1 + 7 + 4 = 12 \n\nAgain, we can't write "12" as a digit in base-11, so we write "B" to represent the value of 12. So the digit in the 11's place of our answer is "B". \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n73 + 44 = 117 \n\nIn base-11, this is written as: \n\n\\boxed{7A\\ B}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 18 and 96 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 6. \n\n8 + 6 = A (since 8 + 6 = 14 in base-10, which is equivalent to A in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 1's place:\n\n1 + 1 + 9 = B (since 1 + 1 + 9 = 11 in base-10, which is equivalent to B in base-11)\n\nTherefore, 18 + 96 = AB in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{AB}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 11+7A, we start by adding the digits in the ones place, which gives us 1+7 = 8. Since 8 is less than 11, we write it down as the ones digit of our answer. Next, we move to the elevens place and add the digits there, which gives us 1+0 = 1. Again, 1 is less than 11, so we write it down as the elevens digit of our answer. Therefore, 11+7A = \\boxed{18A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 51+A5? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 51 and A5 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 5. This gives us 6, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is 5 in 51 and A in A5. To add these, we convert A to its decimal equivalent, which is 10. Then we add 5 and 10, which gives us 15. However, 15 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry over" the extra digit. We can do this by dividing 15 by 11, which gives us a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 4. We write down the remainder (4) as the next digit in our answer, and "carry over" the quotient (1) to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 in 51 and nothing in A5 (since A is the leftmost digit). We also need to add the "carry over" from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us a total of 2. We write down 2 as the leftmost digit of our answer.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{246}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 4A and 9A, we can start by adding the units digits, which are A and A. In base-11, A+A=10, so we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 4 and 9, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-11, 4+9+1=14, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11. We write down A in the elevens place and carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundredths place, which is just the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So the final result is 1A0 in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 4A+9A=\\boxed{1A0}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 94 and 63 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 3. This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 94 and the 6 in 63. When we add these, we get 15. However, in base-11, we can only use digits 0-9 and A, so we need to carry over the extra digit. 15 in base-11 is equivalent to 1A, so we write down the A and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (the carried over digit) and 0. This gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 94+63 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{7A1}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 6A and 84 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits in the ones place:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ 84\n---\n```\n\nSince A is the equivalent of 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next place value when the sum of the digits in a column is greater than 10. In this case, 4 + A = E (which is equivalent to 14 in base-10), so we carry over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ 84\n---\n  9E\n```\n\nTherefore, 6A + 84 = 9E in base-11.\n\n$\\boxed{9E}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-10, A represents the number 10. Therefore, in base-11, A represents the number 10 as well.\n\nNow we can substitute A with 10 in the expression A2+30:\n\nA2+30 = 102+30\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n102+30 = 100+32 = 132\n\nTherefore, the result is:\n\n\\boxed{132}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 98 and 65 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 5. \n\n8 + 5 = D (since D is the digit that comes after 9 in base-11) \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens place.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add AA and 12 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are A and 2. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have:\n\nA + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12\n\nSince 12 is greater than 10 (which is the highest digit in base-11), we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over 1 means subtracting 11 from the current digit. So we have:\n\nA + 2 = 12 - 11 = 1\n\nWe write down the 1 in the result and carry over the 1 to the next digit. Now we need to add the next digits, which are A and 1 (the carried over digit). We have:\n\nA + 1 + 1 = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12\n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we have:\n\nA + 1 + 1 = 12 - 11 = 1\n\nWe write down the 1 in the result and carry over the 1 to the next digit.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 6 and 7. Adding these gives us 13, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit, which is the 11's place. \n\nIn the 11's place, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 6 and 7 (from the original numbers).

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 40+63? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 40 and 63 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 3 is greater than 1. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 4 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 11 in base-11, which is written as "A". We write down the "1" and carry-over the "A" to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is "A". This gives us 17 in base-11, which is written as "16". \n\nTherefore, 40+63 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{16A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 67 and 44 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 4. This gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in base-11. We write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 6 and 4 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 11 again, so we write down another 1 and carry-over another 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 1 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 2.\n\nTherefore, 67+44 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{112}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 6A and 34 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are A and 4. A + 4 = E (since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10). So we write down E and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 6 and 3, and add the carried-over 1. 6 + 3 + 1 = A (since 10 + 1 = A in base-11). So we write down A in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 6A + 34 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{EA}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding values in base-11. \n\nA = 10 \n\nNow we can add the numbers: \n\n15 + A8 = 15 + 10*11 + 8 \n\n= 15 + 110 + 8 \n\n= 133 \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{133}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 1A and 35 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 35\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 5. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 35\n---\n   F\n```\n\nThe sum of A and 5 is equal to F in base-11. We write down the F and carry-over the 1 to the next column. Now we need to add 1, the carry-over, to the next digit, which is 1. This gives us:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 35\n---\n  10F\n```\n\nThe sum of 1 and 1 is equal to 2, but we need to represent it in base-11. Since 2 is less than 11, we can write it as 2 in base-11. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 35\n---\n  10F\n= 110 + 15 + 10\n= 135\n```\n\nTherefore, 1A+35 in base-11 is equal to $\\boxed{135}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 72 and 47 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 7. This gives us 9. We write down the 9 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 7 and 4, and add the carried-over 1. This gives us 12. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 1A (11+1). We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1. We also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 2. We write down the 2. \n\nTherefore, 72+47 in base-11 is \\boxed{A2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 72+64? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 72 and 64 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 4. In base-11, 2+4=6, so we write down 6 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. In base-11, we represent 10 as "A". Adding the digits in the 10's place, we have 7+6=13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry over" the extra digit. In base-11, 13 is equivalent to 1A (since 1+10=11, and we represent 11 as "A" in base-11). Therefore, we write down "A" as the digit in the 10's place of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 100's place, which are both 1. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we have 1+1+1=3. Therefore, we write down 3 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  72\n+ 64\n----\n 136\n\nTherefore, 72+64=136 in base-11, and we can write the result as $\\boxed{136}$.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 3A and 66 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are A and 6. A + 6 = 10, which is equal to A in base-11 (since we only have one-digit numbers). We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 3 and 6 (plus the carried-over 1). 3 + 6 + 1 = A, so we write down A and carry-over the 1 again. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which is just the carried-over 1. So the final result is 10A, which is equal to $\\boxed{121}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 4. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 7 and 7 (since A represents 10 in base-11). This gives us 14, which is greater than 10. \n\nIn base-11, we represent 14 as "13", where the 1 represents one group of 11 and the 3 represents the remaining 3 units. We write down the 3 in the 1's place and carry the 1 to the next digit.\n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, which is the 11's place, we add the digits in this place, which are 0 and 1 (the carried 1 from the previous step). This gives us 1. \n\nFinally, we write down the result as "\\boxed{143}" in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 8.\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 98 and the 8 in 80. When we add these two digits, we get 17 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. In base-11, 17 is written as 16 with a carry-over of 1. Therefore, we write down the digit 6 and carry-over the 1.\n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, we add the carried-over 1 to the 9 in 98. This gives us 10 in base-11, which is written as A.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 in 98 and 8 in 80.

To add A1 and 76 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 76\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding 1 and 6, which gives us 7. We write down the 7 and carry-over the 1:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 76\n---\n   7\n```\n\nNext, we add the 1 from the carry-over to A, which gives us B (since A+1=10):\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 76\n---\n  B7\n```\n\nTherefore, A1+76 = \\boxed{B7} in base-11.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Adding 3 and 9 gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11. However, since we are carrying over a digit to the next place value, we write down the 2 from 12 and carry over the A to the next place value. Finally, we add the 1's place digits, which are 1 and A (the carried over digit). This gives us B. Therefore, 30+92 in base-11 is \\boxed{B2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have:\n\nA + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12\n\nSince 12 is greater than 10 (the highest digit in base-11), we need to carry over to the next digit. We divide 12 by 11 and get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1, which is equivalent to the digit "1" in base-11. We write down the remainder (1) and carry over the quotient (1) to the next digit:\n\nA + 2 = 1A (with a carry of 1)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the carried-over 1:\n\nA + 9 + 1 = B (with no carry)\n\nTherefore, AA + 92 = \\boxed{BB}.

To add A1 and AA, we can start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n  A 1\n+ A A\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, A + 1 = B (since A is the 10th digit and 1 is the first digit, which add up to 11, which is B in base-11). So we write down B and carry-over 1:\n\n```\n  A 1\n+ A A\n-----\n  B\n```\n\nMoving to the second digit from the right, we have 1 + A = B (since 1 is the first digit and A is the 10th digit, which add up to 11, which is B in base-11). But we also have a carry-over of 1 from the previous digit, so we need to add that as well: 1 + A + 1 = B + 1. So we write down B + 1 and carry-over 1 again:\n\n```\n  A 1\n+ A A\n-----\n  B 1\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits: A + A = 14 (since A is the 10th digit and we're adding two of them, which add up to 20, which is 14 in base-11). But we also have a carry-over of 1 from the previous digit, so we need to add that as well: A + A + 1 = 15.

Since 4+5=9, the rightmost digit of the sum is 9. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11, we have to carry-over 1 to the next digit.

To add 2A and 39 in base-11, we start by adding the units digit, which is 9+ A = B (since A is the 10th digit in base-11). We write down the digit B and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the 11s digit, which is 3+2 = 5. We add the carry-over from the previous step to get 5+1 = 6.

Since 8+9=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  28\n +99\n----\n  17  <- rightmost digits\n```\n\nCarrying over 1 to the next digit, we add 2+9+1=12 to get:\n\n```\n  28\n +99\n----\n  28\n  1   <- carry over\n```\n\nNow we add the next digits, which are 2 and 0 (including the carried-over 1). 2+0+1=3, so we have:\n\n```\n  28\n +99\n----\n  28\n  3   <- next digit\n```\n\nTherefore, 28+99 in base-11 is equal to $\\boxed{103}$.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Adding 3 and 9 gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11. However, since we are carrying over a digit to the next place value, we write down the 2 from 12 and carry over the A to the next place value.

To add A6 and 67 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n A6\n+67\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the units digits, which gives us 6+7=13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next column. In base-11, carrying over 1 from the units column means adding 1 to the next column. So we write down the 3 in the units column, and carry over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n A6\n+67\n---\n  3\n```\n\nNow we add the digits in the next column, which are A and 6 (remember that A represents the digit 10 in base-10). A+6=10, so we write down 0 in the next column and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n A6\n+67\n---\n  30\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 and nothing (since we carried over the 1 from the previous column). 1+0=1, so we write down 1 in the next column:\n\n```\n A6\n+67\n---\n  301\n```\n\nTherefore, A6+67=301 in base-11. \n\n$$\\boxed{301}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 18 and 7A in base-11, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n```\n  18\n+ 7A\n----\n```\n\nSince A represents the value 10 in base-10, we can rewrite the problem as:\n\n```\n  18\n+ 70\n----\n```\n\nNow we can add the digits in the ones place, which gives us a sum of 8.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 92 and 4A in base-11, we first need to make sure that we are carrying over any excess digits when the sum of two digits is greater than 10. \n\nStarting with the units digit, we have 2 + A = B, where B is the units digit of the sum. If A is less than or equal to 8, then B is simply the sum of 2 and A. However, if A is 9 or greater, then we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-11, carrying over a digit means adding 1 to the next place value. Since A is the highest digit in this base, we carry over by setting the units digit to 0 and adding 1 to the next place value. Therefore, if A is 9 or greater, then B is A-11+2 = A-9.\n\nMoving on to the next place value, we have 9 + 4 = D. Since D is less than 10, we don't need to carry over any digits. Therefore, the final sum is BD, which is equal to A-9D. \n\nSubstituting in the value of B, we get:\n\nBD = (A-9)D + 2\n\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\nBD = AD - 9D + 2\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nBD = AD - (9D - 2)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{AD - (9D - 2)}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 6A and 80 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ 80\n----\n```\n\nSince A is the 10th digit in base-11, we need to carry over to the next digit when the sum is greater than or equal to 11. Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ 80\n----\n   0  (6+8=14, carry over 1)\n  10A (1+10+0=11, carry over 1)\n----\n  10B\n```\n\nTherefore, 6A+80 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{10B}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 36 and 29 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 9. Since 6+9=15, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 15 is one more than the largest digit A in base-11). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 2, and we add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 3+2+1=6, so we write down the digit 6 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, 36+29=65 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{65}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 83 and 88 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 8. \n\n3 + 8 = B (since 3 + 8 = 11 in base-10, which is represented as "B" in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since 3 + 8 = 11) to the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 3. \n\n1 + 8 + 3 = C (since 1 + 8 + 3 = 12 in base-10, which is represented as "C" in base-11)\n\nTherefore, 83 + 88 = BC in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{BC}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 76 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 7A\n----\n  1G\n```\n\nThe sum of the units digits is G, which represents the value 16 in base-10. However, in base-11, we can only use digits up to A, so we need to carry-over again. This time, we carry-over to the next digit, which gives us:\n\n```\n  76\n+ 7A\n----\n  1G\n   1\n----\n  88\n```\n\nThe sum of the tens digits is 7 plus 1 (from the carry-over) which gives us 8.

We then move to the next digit to the left, which is A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So we add 1 (from the 7 in 70) and 10 (from the A in A7), which gives us 11. However, 11 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry over 1 to the next digit to the left. \n\nThe next digit to the left is 0, so we add 1 to 0, which gives us 1. Finally, we have our answer: \n\n70 + A7 = 7 11 1 \n\nHowever, we need to express this in base-11 using the digits "0123456789A".

This gives us 18, which is equal to one group of 11 and 7 left over. We write down the 7 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 6 and 3, and add the carried 1 from the previous step. This gives us 10, which is equal to one group of 11 and 0 left over. We write down the 0 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 and 3, and add the carried 1 from the previous step.

Since 5+6=11, we write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 5. We get 1+5=6. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carried-over digit) and 1.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. Adding 8 and 3 gives us 11, which is equal to A in base-11. However, we cannot write A as a single digit in this column, so we carry-over the 1 to the next column. Finally, we add the carried-over 1 to the hundreds digit, which gives us 1+8+3=12, which is equal to B in base-11. Therefore, 88+30= \\boxed{B8} in base-11.

To add 89 and 47 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 7. \n\n9 + 7 = 16 \n\nSince 16 is greater than 10 (represented by the digit A), we need to carry over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNow we add the next digits to the left, which are 8 and 4, and add the carried-over 1: \n\n8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \n\nAgain, since 13 is greater than 10, we carry over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1 (from the carried-over 1): \n\n0 + 1 = 1 \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n89 + 47 = 136 \n\nTherefore, the result in base-11 is: \n\n\\boxed{136}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 92+6A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 92 and 6A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and A. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nIn the next digit, we add 9, 1 (from the carry-over), and 6, which gives us 16. However, 16 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to regroup. We can regroup 16 as 11 + 5, where 5 is the digit we write in the current digit place, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, in the next digit, we add 1 (from the carry-over) and 0, which gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 92 + 6A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{A5}1.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 37+90? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 37 and 90 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 0. This gives us 7. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 3 and 9. Adding these gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit, which is the 11's place. \n\nIn the 11's place, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 3 and 9 (from the original numbers). This gives us 13, which is also greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over another 1 to the next digit, which is the 121's place. \n\nIn the 121's place, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 1 (from the 10's place) and 0 (from the 100's place). This gives us 2. \n\nTherefore, the final result is $\\boxed{A2}$ in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 91 and 95 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 5. This gives us 6. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 10's place, which are 9 and 5. This gives us 15. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 4 with a carry-over of 1. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 100's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digit in the 100's place, which is 0. This gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 91+95 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{146}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	A5 represents the number 10 in base-10, and A7 represents the number 12 in base-10. To add them in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 0 (5+7=12, which is equivalent to 0 in base-11). We then carry-over the 1 to the next column, which gives us 1 (1+1=2) in the tens column. Therefore, A5+A7=1\\boxed{0}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 66 and 95 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 5. This gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in the next place value. We write down the 1 in the next place value and carry over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 6. This gives us 7. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 9 and 0. This gives us 9. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  66\n+ 95\n----\n 101A\n\nTherefore, 66+95 in base-11 is \\boxed{101A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A3 and 16 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A3\n+ 16\n----\n```\n\nWe can see that 3 + 6 = 9, which is represented as the digit 9 in base-11. We write down the 9 and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  A3\n+ 16\n----\n   9\n```\n\nNext, we add A and 1, which gives us B (since A is the 10th digit and 1 is the first digit):\n\n```\n  A3\n+ 16\n----\n  B9\n```\n\nTherefore, A3 + 16 = \\boxed{B9} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to first convert A and 6 to base-10. \n\nA in base-11 is equal to 10 in base-10 (since A represents the value of 10 in this system). \n\n6 in base-11 is equal to 6 in base-10 (since 6 is already a digit in both systems). \n\nSo, A2+61 in base-11 is equal to 102+61 in base-10. \n\nAdding these two numbers in base-10, we get:\n\n102+61 = 163 \n\nTherefore, A2+61 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{163}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 70 and 85 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 5. This gives us 5, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 7 and 8. Adding these gives us 15, which is one digit in base-11. We write down the 5 as the next digit in our answer, and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nMoving to the next column, which is the 11's place, we add the carried-over 1 to the digits in this column, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 9, which we write down as the next digit in our answer. \n\nTherefore, 70+85 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{159}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A9 and 5A, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and A. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so 9 + A = 13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to regroup. We can regroup 13 as 1A, where 1 carries over to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are A and 5. A + 5 = F, which is a valid digit in base-11. \n\nTherefore, the sum of A9 and 5A is 1AF in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{1AF}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 59 and 86 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 6. This gives us 15, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 5 ones. Since we are in base-11, we can only have up to 10 ones before we need to regroup them as a ten. Therefore, we write down the 5 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 5 and 8, and we add the carried-over ten from the previous step. This gives us 14, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 4 ones. We write down the 4 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried over the ten from the previous step). This gives us 1.\n\nTherefore, the result of 59+86 in base-11 is \\boxed{104}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 30 and 84 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 4. This gives us 4. We then move to the next digits, which are 3 and 8. This gives us 11, but since we are in base-11, we write this as 10 with a carry of 1. We continue this process with the next digits, which are 0 and 8, giving us 8. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (from the carry), giving us 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 46 and 25 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11, we carry-over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 0. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 and 2 (the digits in the tens place). We also add the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. So we have 1+2+1=4. We write down the remainder, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, 46+25=100 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{100}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 2+9=11, we write down 1 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 1, which gives us 2. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 7 (since there are no carried-over digits left). This gives us 7. \n\nTherefore, 12+79=102 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 15 and 88 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 8. Since 5+8=13, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 13 is one more than the largest digit A in base-11). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the left, which are 1 and 8 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the next digit in each number). Since 1+8+1=10, we write down the digit A and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the next digit in each number). Since 0+1+1=2, we write down the digit 2. \n\nTherefore, 15+88=2A2 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{2A2}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add 8, 1 (from carrying over the 1 from the previous step), and 2, which gives us 11. However, in base-11, we represent 11 as "A", so we write down "A" in the 10's place. Therefore, the sum of 87 and 20 in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{A7}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 96 and the 5 in 50. Adding these gives us 14, which is one group of 11 with 3 left over. We write down the 3 and carry the 1 to the next digit. Moving to the left again, we add the carried 1 to the 9, giving us 10. We then add the 0 from 50 to get 10. Finally, we add the carried 1 to get 11. We write down the 1 and carry the other 1 to the next digit. Since there are no more digits to add, we write down the carried 1.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 3A+70? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 3A and 70 in base-11, we first need to align the digits by place value:\n\n  3A\n+ 70\n----\n  9A\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, A + 0 = A. Moving to the left, A + 7 = 10 (since A is the 10th digit in base-11), but we can't write 10 as a single digit in base-11, so we carry-over 1 to the next column. In the next column, 1 + 3 = 4. Therefore, the sum of 3A and 70 in base-11 is 9A:\n\n  3A\n+ 70\n----\n  9A\n\nSo, 3A+70=\\boxed{9A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 93 and 96 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 6. \n\n3 + 6 = 9 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 9. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 9 and 6 (since we carried over a 1 from the previous step). \n\n9 + 6 = A (which represents 10 in base-11) \n\nSo the digit in the 10's place of our answer is A. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 100's place. There are no digits in this place for either number, so we can simply write down the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n93 + 96 = 1A9 in base-11 \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1A9}.

Since 2+9=11, we write down 1 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 2, which gives us 3.

This gives us 7, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1 in 61 and the 7 in 76. Adding these gives us 8. We write down 8 as the second digit from the right in our answer. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 6 and 0 (since there is no digit to the left of the 7 in 76). This gives us 6. We write down 6 as the leftmost digit in our answer. \n\nTherefore, 61+76 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{86}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 73 and 86 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 6. \n\n3 + 6 = 9 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 9. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 1's place: \n\n7 + 6 + 0 = 13 \n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to regroup 13 as 1A (1 ten and A ones).

To add A9 and 83 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n A 9\n+  8 3\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 3. In base-11, 9+3=12, which is one digit too large to fit in a single digit. Therefore, we write down the rightmost digit of the result (2) and carry-over the leftmost digit (1):\n\n```\n A 9\n+  8 3\n-----\n    2\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second position from the right, which are A and 8, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step. In base-11, A+8+1=14, which is also too large to fit in a single digit. Therefore, we write down the rightmost digit of the result (4) and carry-over the leftmost digit (1):\n\n```\n A 9\n+  8 3\n-----\n   42\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third position from the right, which are 0 and 0, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to first convert 7A and 28 into base-10 numbers, perform the addition, and then convert the result back into base-11.\n\nTo convert 7A into base-10, we can use the formula:\n\n7A = 7*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 77 + 10 = 87\n\nTo convert 28 into base-10, we can use the formula:\n\n28 = 2*11^1 + 8*11^0 = 22 + 8 = 30\n\nNow we can add 87 and 30 in base-10:\n\n87 + 30 = 117\n\nTo convert 117 back into base-11, we can use the division algorithm.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 77 and 2A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  77\n+ 2A\n----\n  9H\n```\n\nThe sum of 7 and A is H, which represents the value 17 in base-10. We write down the H in the units digit and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. Then, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 2 (with the carry-over). This gives us 9, which we write down in the tens place. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{9H}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to add the units digits, which are 6 and 8. In base-11, 6+8=14, which is equal to A in our digit system. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 2 and 9, and add the carry-over from the previous step. In base-11, 2+9+1=12, which is equal to B in our digit system. We write down the B and there is no carry-over to the next column.\n\nTherefore, 26+98=BA in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{BA}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 33+18? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 33 and 18 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 8. Since 3+8=11, we write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 3. This gives us 4. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 0 (since there is no digit in the third column for 33) and 1 (the carried-over digit). This gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 33+18=41 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{41}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 37+69? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 37 and 69 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 9. Since 7+9=16, which is greater than 10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down the digit 6 (which is 16-11) in the units place, and carry-over the digit 1 to the next place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place, which are 3 and 6 (the carried-over digit). We get 9, which we write down in the next place. \n\nTherefore, 37+69=106 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{106}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

These add up to 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 5. These add up to 6, so we write down 6 in the second column from the right.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carried-over digit) and 2. These add up to 2, so we write down 2 in the third column from the right.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{A62} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 52 and 6A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and A. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the 1s digits, which are 5 and 6. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 12. However, 12 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit again. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the 11s digit, which is 1. We get 1+1=2. \n\nTherefore, 52+6A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{102}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 10's place, which are 9 and 2. This gives us 11. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 10 and 1. We write down the 1 in the 10's place and carry-over the 10 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 100's place, which are 0 and 9. This gives us 10. Again, we regroup this as 9 and 1. \n\nTherefore, 95+92 in base-11 is equal to 171. \n\n\\boxed{171}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 78 and 53 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 3. \n\n8 + 3 = A (since 8 + 3 = 11 in base-10, which is represented as "A" in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 7 in 78 and the 5 in 53. We add these digits along with the carry from the previous step (which is 1, since 8 + 3 = A in base-11). \n\n7 + 5 + 1 = D (since 7 + 5 + 1 = 13 in base-10, which is represented as "D" in base-11)\n\nTherefore, 78 + 53 = \\boxed{AD} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 94 and 76 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 6. This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 9 and 7, and add the carry-over from the previous step. This gives us 17, which is equal to 1A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step. This gives us 2, which is equal to 2 in base-11. We write down the 2.\n\nTherefore, 94+76=1A2 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{1A2}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to first convert the base-11 number "2A" into base-10. \n\nTo do this, we can use the formula: \n\n(2A)base-11 = 2*11^1 + A*11^0 = 22 + A \n\nNow we can add 22 + A to 32: \n\n(22 + A) + 32 = 54 + A \n\nTherefore, 2A+32 in base-11 is \\boxed{54A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to determine the value of "AA" in base-10. In base-11, "A" represents the value of 10, so "AA" would represent 11 times 10 plus 10, which is 120.\n\nNext, we can add 19 and 120 in base-10, which gives us 139.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 139 back into base-11. 139 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 12 with a remainder of 7, which corresponds to the digit "7" in base-11. Therefore, 139 in base-11 is "127".\n\nPutting it all together, 19+AA in base-11 is:\n\n19 + AA = 19 + 120 = 139 = \\boxed{127}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 1+9=10, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 9 and 4, and add the carried-over digit of 1. We get 9+4+1=14. Since 14 is greater than 10, we write down the digit A (which represents 10 in base-11) and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1, and add the carried-over digit of 1.

Since 8+4=12, we write down the 2 and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are A and 2, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. A+2+1=10, so we write down 0 and carry-over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and nothing, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. 0+0+1=1, so we write down 1. \n\nTherefore, A8+24=10A\\boxed{1} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and A4 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 4. Since 5+4=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 85. We add this to the next digit from the right in A4, which is A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So 8+A=18, which is written as 8 with a carry-over of 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over of 1 to the leftmost digit of 85, which is 1.

We add the carry from the previous step (which is 1, since A represents 11 in base-10) to the digits 8 and 3.

We add the digits in this place, which are 9 and 2, and also add any "carry" from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). In base-11, 9+2=10, but we write this as "A" since we are using the digit "A" to represent the value of 10.

We write down B in the 121s place:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 58\n---\nB9\n```\n\nTherefore, A1 + 58 = \\boxed{B9} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 88 and 77 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 7. \n\n8 + 7 = 15 \n\nSince 15 is greater than 10 (represented by the digit A), we need to carry over to the next column. We carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 5. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column: \n\n8 + 7 + 1 = 16 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next column since 16 is greater than 10. We carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 6. \n\nTherefore, 88 + 77 in base-11 is equal to 155. \n\n\\boxed{155}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 52 and 48 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 8. \n\n2 + 8 = A (since 10 is represented by the digit A in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 5 in 52 and the 4 in 48. We add the result of the previous step (A) to these digits:\n\n5 + 4 + A = 13\n\nSince 13 is greater than 10, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. So we write down the digit 3 and carry over the 1:\n\n1 3\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0:\n\n1 3 0\n\nTherefore, 52 + 48 = \\boxed{130} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 86 and A6 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and A. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so 6 + A = 10 + 6 = 16. \n\nHowever, 16 is greater than 10, which is the largest digit in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the extra 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8, which gives us 9. Finally, in the leftmost column, we have the digit 0 (since there is no carry-over from the previous column). \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{90A}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 91+57? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 91 and 57 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 7. This gives us 8. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 91 and the 5 in 57. Adding these gives us 14, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNow we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit, which is the 1 in 91 and the 5 in 57, as well as the 1 we carried over. This gives us 8+5+1=14. Again, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is the 0 in 91 and the 1 in 57, as well as the 1 we carried over. This gives us 1+1+1=3. \n\nTherefore, 91+57 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{83}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 61+3A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 61 and 3A in base-11, we first need to convert A to its decimal equivalent. A represents the value 10 in base-10, so in base-11, it represents the value 11.\n\nNow we can add the two numbers:\n\n  61\n+ 3A\n---\n  9B\n\nHowever, we need to remember that we are working in base-11, so if the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 11, we need to carry over to the next digit. In this case, 1 + A = B, which is greater than or equal to 11. So we carry over the 1 to the leftmost digit:\n\n  61\n+ 3A\n---\n  9B\n\nTherefore, the final result is \\boxed{9B} in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 1A+39? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 1A and 39 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 39\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 9. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 39\n----\n   9\n```\n\nThe result of adding A and 9 is 9, but we also need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over happens when the sum is greater than or equal to 11. In this case, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 39\n----\n  19\n```\n\nNow we can add the next digits, which are 1 and 3:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 39\n----\n  19\n +3\n----\n```\n\nThe result of adding 1 and 3 is 4, so we have:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 39\n----\n  49\n```\n\nWe don't need to carry over to the next digit, so this is our final answer. In base-10, 49 represents the value 5*11 + 4 = 59. Therefore, our final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{49}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 93 and the 1 in 10. Adding these gives us 10 in base-11, which we write as A. Therefore, the sum of 93 and 10 in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{A3}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 78+A7? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 78 and A7 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 7. Since 8+7=15, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n 78\n+A7\n---\n 15\n```\n\nWe write down the 5 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 78\n+A7\n---\n 15\n  1\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1, 8, and A (which represents 10 in base-10). 1+8+A=19, which is greater than 10, so we carry over again:\n\n```\n 78\n+A7\n---\n 15\n  1\n  9\n```\n\nWe write down the 9 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 78\n+A7\n---\n 15\n  1\n  9\n  1\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 1 and 7. 1+7=8, so we write down the 8:\n\n```\n 78\n+A7\n---\n 15\n  1\n  9\n  1\n  8\n```\n\nTherefore, 78+A7 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1918}.

This gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in base-10 and is represented as "A" in base-11. We write down the "A" and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 5. This gives us 6. We write down the 6 in the second column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are 4 and 0 (since there is no carry-over from the second column). This gives us 4.

This gives us 5, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 5 is greater than 1. \n\nIn base-11, carrying over from 5 means adding 1 to the next digit, which is A. So we have:\n\n```\n  40\n+ 85\n----\n  A5\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 8, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 13, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 13 is greater than 10. \n\nIn base-11, carrying over from 13 means adding 1 to the next digit, which is 1. So we have:\n\n```\n  40\n+ 85\n----\n 15A\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A3 and 78, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 7 8\n-----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding 3 and 8, which gives us 11. In base-11, we write this as "10" and carry-over the 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 7 8\n-----\n    0\n```\n\nNext, we add A (which represents 10 in base-10) and 1, which gives us B (which represents 11 in base-10):\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 7 8\n-----\n   B0\n```\n\nTherefore, A3+78 = \\boxed{B0} in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 57+45? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 57 and 45 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 5. \n\n7 + 5 = C (since C is the digit that represents 12 in base-11, which is the result of adding 7 and 5 in base-10)\n\nSo the rightmost digit of our sum is C. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since we had to carry-over a 1 from the previous step when we added 7 and 5) to the digits in the 10's place: \n\n5 + 4 + 1 = A (since A is the digit that represents 11 in base-11, which is the result of adding 5, 4, and 1 in base-10)\n\nSo the digit in the 10's place of our sum is A. \n\nTherefore, 57 + 45 = \\boxed{AC}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 9A+11? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert 9A to base-10. A in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so 9A in base-11 is equal to 9*11 + 10 = 109 in base-10. \n\nNext, we can simply add 11 to 109 to get our final answer: \n\n109 + 11 = 120 \n\nTherefore, 9A+11 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{120}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 73 in base-11, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 3. This gives us 8, which we can write as "73" in base-11. Next, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 7 (since we carried over a 1 from the units place). This gives us 15, which we can write as "A4" in base-11 (since 10 is represented by the digit "A"). Therefore, 85+73 = \\boxed{A4 73} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to understand the value of each digit in base-11. \n\nIn base-11, the digit "A" represents the value of 10. Therefore, we can rewrite 70+A0 as 70+10+0. \n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\n70+10+0 = 80\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{80}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 1+3=4, we write down 4 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 7 in 71 and the 5 in 53. Since 7+5=12, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. We write down the 2 as the second digit from the right in the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are the 1 in 71 and the 0 in 53 (remember that A represents 10 in base-11). Since 1+0+1=2, we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{220}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 0 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 6 and 4. Adding these gives us 10, which is represented as "A" in base-11. We write down "A" as the next digit of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digits, which are both 0.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 16 and 90 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 0. This gives us 6. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 1 and A. To add these, we convert A to 10 and then add 1+10=11. However, 11 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. Thus, we have 1 carry and a sum of 0 in the 1's place. Finally, we add the carry to the next digit, which is the 11's place. Here, we have 9 and 0. Adding the carry gives us 10, which we can write as A. Thus, the final result is:\n\n16 + 90 = \\boxed{A6}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 31 and A9 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and 9. Since 1 + 9 = A (in base-11), we write down A as the units digit of the sum and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and A (the carried-over 1 from the previous column plus the digit in the tens place of A9). Since 3 + A = D (in base-11), we write down D as the tens digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 31+A9 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{DA}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We add the 1 from 41 to the 8 from 83, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 0. \n\n1 + 8 + 0 = 9 \n\nSo the next digit of our answer is 9. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 11's place. We add the 4 from 41 to the 3 from 83, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 0. \n\n4 + 3 + 0 = 7 \n\nSo the leftmost digit of our answer is 7. \n\nTherefore, 41 + 83 in base-11 is \\boxed{794}.

Therefore, $|f(x)-p_{n+1}(x)| \\leq \\frac{M}{n+1}$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$, which implies that $p_{n+1}$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$. Since $p_{n+1}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$, the induction is complete. $\\blacksquare$\n\n# Answer\n\n\\frac{1}{2}e^{-1}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-2}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-3}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-4}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-5}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-6}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-7}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-8}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-9}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-10}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-11}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-12}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-13}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-14}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-15}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-16}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-17}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-18}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-19}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-20}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-21}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-22}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-23}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-24}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-25}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-26}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-27}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-28}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-29}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-30}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-31}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-32}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-33}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-34}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-35}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-36}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-37}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-38}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-39}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-40}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-41}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-42}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-43}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-44}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-45}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-46}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-47}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-48}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-49}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-50}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-51}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-52}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-53}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-54}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-55}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-56}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-57}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-58}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-59}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-60}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-61}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-62}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-63}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-64}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-65}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-66}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-67}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-68}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-69}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-70}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-71}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-72}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-73}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-74}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-75}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-76}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-77}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-78}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-79}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-80}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-81}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-82}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-83}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-84}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-85}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-86}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-87}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-88}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-89}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-90}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-91}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-92}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-93}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-94}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-95}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-96}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-97}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-98}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-99}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-100}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-101}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-102}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-103}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-104}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-105}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-106}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-107}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-108}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-109}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-110}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-111}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-112}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-113}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-114}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-115}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-116}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-117}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-118}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-119}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-120}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-121}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-122}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-123}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-124}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-125}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-126}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-127}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-128}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-129}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-130}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-131}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-132}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-133}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-134}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-135}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-136}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-137}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-138}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-139}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-140}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-141}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-142}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-143}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-144}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-145}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-146}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-147}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-148}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-149}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-150}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-151}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-152}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-153}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-154}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-155}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-156}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-157}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-158}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-159}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-160}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-161}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-162}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-163}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-164}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-165}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-166}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-167}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-168}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-169}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-170}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-171}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-172}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-173}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-174}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-175}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-176}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-177}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-178}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-179}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-180}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-181}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-182}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-183}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-184}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-185}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-186}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-187}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-188}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-189}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-190}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-191}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-192}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-193}+\\frac{1}{2}e^{-194}+\\	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 74 and 71 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 1. This gives us 5, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 7 in 74 and the 1 in 71. Adding these gives us 8. However, we also need to add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). So our total for this digit is 8. We write down the rightmost digit of this total (which is 8) as the next digit in our answer, and carry-over the leftmost digit (which is 1) to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (the carry-over from the previous step), 7, and 0.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 72 and A7 in base-11, we start by adding the units column:\n\n7 + 7 = 14\n\nIn base-11, we write 14 as 13 with a carry of 1. So we write down 3 in the units column and carry over the 1 to the 11s column.\n\nNext, we add the 11s column:\n\n1 + 0 + A = B\n\nSo we write down B in the 11s column.\n\nTherefore, 72+A7 in base-11 is \\boxed{B3}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A3+A7? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A3 and A7, we first need to convert them to base-10. \n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so A3 is 10*11^1 + 3*11^0 = 113 in base-10. \n\nSimilarly, A7 is 10*11^1 + 7*11^0 = 117 in base-10. \n\nAdding these two numbers in base-10 gives us 113 + 117 = 230. \n\nNow we need to convert 230 back to base-11. \n\nThe largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 230 is 11^2, which is 121. \n\nSo we have 230 = 1*121 + 10*11 + 9. \n\nTherefore, the sum of A3 and A7 in base-11 is \\boxed{19A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 13 and 89 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 9. Since 3+9=12, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1 and 8 (the digit we carried-over plus the next digit in each number). Since 1+8=9, we write down the digit 9 in the second column. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 13 and 89 in base-11 is \\boxed{92}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 68 and 40 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. This gives us 8. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Adding 6 and 4 gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. However, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit, which is the 11's place. Adding the carried-over 1 to 1 gives us 2. Finally, we have the result:\n\n68\n+40\n---\nA2\n\nTherefore, 68+40 in base-11 is \\boxed{A2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 8A and A3 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are A and 3. A + 3 = D, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ A3\n---\n  D1\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 1 (carried over from the units place) and A. 1 + A = B, so we have:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ A3\n---\n BD1\n```\n\nTherefore, 8A+A3 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{BD1}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 28 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and A. Since A represents the value of 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the carry-over digit (1) to the tens digit (2) and the other addend's tens digit (7), which gives us 10 in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 to the hundreds digit.\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits (1 and 0) and the carry-over digit (1), which gives us 2 in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 28+7A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{20A}.

To add 5A and 67 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  5A\n+ 67\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 7. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  5A\n+ 67\n----\n   H\n```\n\nThe sum of A and 7 is H in base-11. We write down the H and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are 5 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n```\n  5A\n+ 67\n----\n  10H\n```\n\nThe sum of 5, 6, and 1 is 12, which is represented as 10H in base-11. We write down the H and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n```\n  5A\n+ 67\n----\n  10H\n```\n\nThe sum of 0, 0, and 1 is 1, so we write down the 1.\n\nTherefore, 5A+67 in base-11 is equal to 10H1. We can simplify this by noting that H represents the value 2 in base-10, so we have:\n\n5A+67 = 10H1 = 1021\n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{1021}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 4 and 6, and add the carry-over from the previous step. This gives us 11, which is equal to 10 in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just the carry-over from the previous step. This gives us 1, which we write down.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  42\n+ 68\n----\n A0\n----\nTherefore, 42+68 in base-11 is \\boxed{A0}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 14 again, which is equal to 1 hundred and 4 tens. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0 (plus the carried-over 1).

To add 88 and 45 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 5. \n\n8 + 5 = D (since D is the digit that comes after 9 in base-11)\n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is D. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since D represents 11 in base-10) to the digits in the 10's place: \n\n8 + 4 + 1 = 12 \n\nSince 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next digit (the 11's place) and write the remainder (which is 2) in the 10's place. \n\nSo the 10's place of our answer is 2. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since we carried-over a 1 from the 10's place) to the digits in the 11's place: \n\n1 + 0 + 4 = 5 \n\nSo the 11's place of our answer is 5. \n\nTherefore, \n\n88 + 45 = \\boxed{5D2} in base-11.

This gives us 16, which is equivalent to the digit 5 in base-11. We write down the 5 in the second column from the right.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carried-over digit) plus 4 plus 7.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 81 and 97 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 7. This gives us 8 with a carry of 1. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 8 and 9, and we add the carry of 1 from the previous step.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 75 and 70 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 0. This gives us 5. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. 7+7=14, which is equal to A in base-11. However, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value, which is the 11's place. 1+7+7=15, which is equal to B in base-11. Therefore, 75+70 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{BA}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 26+AA? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert "26" and "AA" into base-10 numbers. \n\n"26" in base-11 is simply 2*11 + 6 = 28. \n\nTo convert "AA" into base-10, we need to remember that "A" represents the value 10 in base-10. So "AA" in base-11 is 10*11 + 10 = 121. \n\nNow we can add these two numbers together: \n\n28 + 121 = 149 \n\nFinally, we need to convert 149 back into base-11. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 11 and keeping track of the remainders. \n\n149 divided by 11 is 13 with a remainder of 6, so the rightmost digit in our base-11 representation is "6". \n\n13 divided by 11 is 1 with a remainder of 2, so the next digit is "2". \n\nFinally, 1 divided by 11 is 0 with a remainder of 1, so the leftmost digit is "1". \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n26 + AA = 149 = \\boxed{126}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 73 and 1A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. \n\n3 + A = D (in base-11)\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 7 and 1. \n\n7 + 1 = 8\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n73 + 1A = 8D in base-11\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{8D}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 54+71? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 54 and 71 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 1. This gives us 5, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1 in 54 and the 7 in 71. Adding these gives us 8. However, we also need to add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). So we have 8+0=8, which we write down as the second digit from the right in our answer. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 5 and 7. This gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. So we need to carry-over the 1 to the next digit. We write down the 2 (which is the rightmost digit of 12) as the leftmost digit of our answer, and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nAdding the carry-over to the next digit (which is 1) and the remaining digit in 54 (which is 5) gives us 7. So we write down 7 as the second digit from the left in our answer. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{121}\n\nTherefore, 54+71 in base-11 is equal to 121.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 64 and 69 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 9. Since 4+9=13, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 13 is one more than the largest digit A). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 9, and add the carried-over digit of 1. We get 6+9+1=16, which is larger than the largest digit A. So, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit of 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 1. We get 1+1=2. \n\nTherefore, 64+69=133 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{133}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 48 and 90 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. This gives us 8.\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the 4 and 9, and we get 13. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup. 13 is equal to 1 ten and 2 ones, but we don't have a symbol for ten, so we write it as A. We carry the A over to the next digit, and we write down the 2 in the 1's place.\n\nFinally, we add the 1 from the previous step to the 9 in the 10's place. This gives us 10, which we write as A.\n\nTherefore, 48+90 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{A28}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 8.\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the 1 from 68 to the 9 from 90, which gives us 10 in base-11. However, 10 is represented by the digit "A" in base-11, so we write down "A" in the 1's place and carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, which is the 11's place, we add the carried-over 1 from the previous step to the 6 from 68 and the 9 from 90. This gives us 16 in base-11. However, 16 is represented by the digits "AB" in base-11, so we write down "B" in the 11's place and carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 121's place. We add the carried-over 1 from the previous step to the 1 from 68 and the 0 from 90. This gives us 2 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, 68+90 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{BA2}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 37 and 1A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  37\n+ 1A\n----\n  47\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 1. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So we have:\n\n```\n  37\n+ 1A\n----\n  47\n+  1\n----\n  48\n```\n\nTherefore, 37+1A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{48}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carry-over) and 5. This gives us 6. We write down the 6 and do not need to carry-over anything to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 3. This gives us 3.

This gives us 15, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 5 ones. We write down the 5 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 2 and 9 (the carried-over 1 plus the original 2). This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones. We write down the 2 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) and 0.

This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 ten and 4 units in base-11. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens column, which are 4 and 8 (remember that A represents 10 in base-11). We also need to add the carried 1 from the previous step. This gives us a total of 13, which is equal to 1 hundred and 2 tens in base-11. We write down the 2 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds column, which are 1 and 0 (since we didn't carry anything over from the previous step).

Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 3 and 6, and add the carried-over digit of 1. We get 3+6+1=10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the digit A in the second column and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit of 1 to the leftmost column, which gives us 1+0=1.

This gives us 9, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right. We have a 9 from the previous step, and we add it to the 7. This gives us 10, which we write down as the second digit from the right in our answer. However, in base-11, we represent 10 with the letter A. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit. We have a 1 from the previous step, and we add it to the 9. This gives us 10 again, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer.

Then we add the digit 8 to get 11, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 1, which gives us 2.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 34 and 4A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  34\n+ 4A\n----\n  7E\n```\n\nThe sum of the units digits is E, which represents the value 14 in base-10. We carry-over 1 to the next digit, which gives us a total of 8 in the tens digit. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n$$\\boxed{8E}$$\n\nNote that E represents the value 14 in base-10, so the final result is equivalent to 8 times 11 plus 14, which is 102 in base-10.

To add 7A and 50 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  7A\n+ 50\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 0. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  7A\n+ 50\n---\n   A\n```\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are 7 and 5, and we also add the carry from the previous step (which is 1):\n\n```\n  7A\n+ 50\n---\n  11A\n```\n\nFinally, we have to add the most significant digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we have a carry from the previous step).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 65 and 9A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. Therefore, the units digit of the sum is 5+10=15, which is equivalent to 4 in base-11 (since 15 is one group of 11 with a remainder of 4).\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 6 and 9. This gives us a sum of 15, which is equivalent to 4 in base-11 (since 15 is one group of 11 with a remainder of 4). However, we also need to add the carry-over from the units place, which is 1. Therefore, the sum of the elevens place is 4+1=5 in base-11.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n65+9A = 4A5 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{4A5}.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the value of each digit in base-11. \n\nIn base-11, the digit "A" represents the value of 10. Therefore, we can rewrite 34+A0 as 34+10+0. \n\nAdding these values together, we get:\n\n34 + 10 + 0 = 44\n\nTherefore, the value of 34+A0 in base-11 is \\boxed{44}.

We get 4+6+1=11, which is equal to the base of our number system. Therefore, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are the carried-over digit of 1 and the digit 0.

We write down the 3 and carry the 1 over to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) and 8. This gives us 9. We write down the 9 in the second column from the right.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carried-over digit) and 2. This gives us 2. We write down the 2 in the third column from the right.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  87\n+26\n---\n A92\n\nTherefore, 87+26 in base-11 is \\boxed{A92}.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 6 and 9. Adding these gives us 15, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 5 ones. However, we are in base-11, so we need to regroup the ten as one unit in the next place to the left. Therefore, we write down the 5 in the 1's place and carry-over the 1 to the 11's place. \n\nMoving to the 11's place, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 2 and 9.

This gives us 9, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1 in 68 and the 7 in 71. Adding these gives us 8, which we write down to the left of the 9 we just wrote. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 6 and 7. This gives us 13, but since we are in base-11, we need to regroup. 13 is equal to 1 ten and 3 ones, so we write down the 3 as the digit to the left of the 8, and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nOur final answer is therefore $\\boxed{139}$ in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 93 and 84 in base-11, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 4. Since 3+4=7, the units digit of the sum is 7. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevenths place, which are 9 and 8. Since 9+8=17, we have to carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nAdding the digits in the 121st place, we have 1+3+4=8. \n\nTherefore, 93+84=181 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{181}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 56+77? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 56 and 77 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 7. These add up to 13, which is greater than 10, so we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n 56\n+77\n---\n 13\n```\n\nCarry over the 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n 56\n+77\n---\n  3\n  1\n```\n\nNow we add the next digits, which are 5 and 7, and add the carry:\n\n```\n 56\n+77\n---\n  3\n 12\n```\n\nCarry over the 1 again:\n\n```\n 56\n+77\n---\n  3\n  3\n  1\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried over the 1 from the previous step):\n\n```\n 56\n+77\n---\n  3\n  3\n  1\n  1\n```\n\nSo the result is $\\boxed{131}$ in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 12 and 95 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 5. Since 2+5=7, we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the "tens" digit. In this case, we have a 1 from 12 and a 9 from 95. Adding them together gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down A as the second digit from the right in the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 1 from 12. This gives us 2, which we write down as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 12+95=107 in base-11, which we write as \\boxed{107}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 5 and 3, and add the carry-over from the previous step. This gives us 9. We write down the 9 and do not need to carry-over anything to the next column. \n\nTherefore, 52+38 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{9A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 8+2=10, we write down 0 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 5 and 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step). 5+1=6, so we write down 6 in the second column from the right.\n\nTherefore, 58+12=60 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{60}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 92+AA? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to determine the value of "AA" in base-10. In base-11, "A" represents the value of 10. Therefore, "AA" in base-11 is equivalent to 11 times the value of "A" plus the value of "A" itself, which is 11 times 10 plus 10, or 120.\n\nNext, we can add 92 and 120 in base-10, which gives us 212.\n\nFinally, we need to convert 212 back into base-11. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 212 is 11^2, which is 121. Therefore, the first digit in our base-11 representation is 1. We subtract 121 from 212 to get 91, which is less than the next power of 11 (11^1 = 11). Therefore, the second digit in our base-11 representation is 9, and the final digit is 1 (since 91 is equal to 8 times 11 plus 3). \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n92 + AA = 92 + 120 (in base-11)\n= 212 (in base-10)\n= 191 (in base-11)\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{191}.

To add 33 and 94 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 4. \n\n3 + 4 = 7 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens place. We add the carry from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the tens place: \n\n3 + 9 + 0 = 12 \n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to regroup 1 from the 12 into the next place value, which is the 11s place. We write down the remainder, which is 1: \n\n12 % 11 = 1 \n\nSo the digit in the 11s place is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we have: \n\n  33\n+ 94\n----\n 127\n\nTherefore, 33+94= \\boxed{127} in base-11.

This gives us 10 in base-11, which is equivalent to the digit "A". We write down the "A" in the units place and carry-over the 1 to the next place value.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 7 (since we carried-over the 1 from the units place). This gives us 14 in base-11, which is equivalent to the digits "12". We write down the "2" in the tens place and carry-over the 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are the carried-over 1 and the digit 0 (since there are no hundreds digits in either number). This gives us 1 in base-11, which is equivalent to the digit "1". We write down the "1" in the hundreds place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{A2A}\n\nTherefore, 72+78 in base-11 is equivalent to the number "A2A".

This gives us 9, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the 1 from 22 to the 9 we carried over from the previous step, giving us 10. However, 10 is represented by the digit "A" in base-11, so we write down "A" as the next digit of our answer and carry over 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we add the 1 from the previous step to the 9 in the 100's place of 97. This gives us 10 again, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 97+22 in base-11 is \\boxed{10A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 92+92? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to add the units column, which gives us 2+2=4. Since 4 is less than 11, we write down 4 in the units column. Next, we move to the elevens column and add 9+9=18. Since 18 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 8 in the elevens column. Finally, we add the carried over 1 to the next column, which gives us 1+9+9=19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 8 in the 121s column. Therefore, 92+92=188 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{188}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A8+98? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A8 and 98 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 9. Since 8+9=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  A8\n +98\n----\n  16\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1, A, and 9. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we need to carry over again:\n\n```\n  A8\n +98\n----\n  16\n +1A\n----\n  B6\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0. We don't need to carry over this time:\n\n```\n  A8\n +98\n----\n  16\n +1A\n----\n  B6\n +00\n----\n  B6\n```\n\nTherefore, A8+98= B6 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{B6}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 85+56? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 56 in base-11, we can start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 6. In base-11, 5+6=10, which is represented by the digit A. So, we write down A as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's digit. In base-11, we have to carry over to the next digit when the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 11. In this case, we have 8+5+1 (the carried-over 1) = 14, which is represented by the digit 13 in base-11. However, since we only have 10 digits (0 to A), we have to represent 13 as 1A. So, we write down A as the 10's digit of the sum, and carry-over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the 100's digit, which is 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step) plus 0 plus 0. This gives us 1 as the 100's digit of the sum.\n\nTherefore, 85+56=1A1 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{1A1}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. In base-11, A represents 10, so we add A and 5, which gives us 14. However, 14 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. We now move to the 100's place, which is the leftmost digit. We add 1 (the carry-over) to 9, which gives us A. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{A7}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 5 in base-11. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the 1 from 44 to the 8 from 81, which gives us 9. But we also have to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So we have 9+1=10 in base-11. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 11's place. We add the 4 from 44 to the 8 from 81, which gives us 12 in base-11. But we also have to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. So we have 12+1=13 in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 44+81=130 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 13 and A1 in base-11, we first need to convert A1 to base-10. \n\nA1 in base-11 is equal to 10*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 111. \n\nNow we can add 13 and 111 in base-10: \n\n13 + 111 = 124 \n\nFinally, we convert 124 back to base-11: \n\n124 = 11*11^1 + 3*11^0 = B3 \n\nTherefore, 13+A1 in base-11 is \\boxed{B3}.

Since 2+9=11, we write down 1 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are A and 6. Since A+6=10, we write down A and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and nothing (since there are no more digits to add). This gives us 1.\n\nTherefore, A2+69= \\boxed{B0} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A2 and 53 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n A 2\n+  5 3\n-----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding 2 and 3, which gives us 5:\n\n```\n A 2\n+  5 3\n-----\n   5\n```\n\nNext, we add A and 5. Since A represents 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit:\n\n```\n A 2\n+  5 3\n-----\n  15\n```\n\nFinally, we add 1 (from the carry) and 2, which gives us 3:\n\n```\n A 2\n+  5 3\n-----\n  63\n```\n\nTherefore, A2+53 = 63 in base-11, and the final answer is $\\boxed{63}$.

This gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digits 7 and 6. This gives us 14, which is also greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over another 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the last column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 1.

This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 94 and the 6 in 63. When we add these, we get 15. However, in base-11, we can only use digits 0-9 and A, so we need to carry over the extra digit. 15 in base-11 is equivalent to 1A, so we write down the A and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (the carried over digit) and 0.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 31 and 76 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 6. This gives us 7, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1 in 31 and the 7 in 76. Adding these gives us 8. We write down 8 as the second digit from the right in our answer. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 3 and 0 (since there is no digit to the left of the 7 in 76). This gives us 3.

To add 80 and 6A in base-11, we start by lining up the digits in the ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 6A\n----\n```\n\nA plus 0 is just A, so we write that down in the ones place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 6A\n----\n   A\n```\n\nNext, we move on to the elevens place. There's a 0 in the elevens place of 80, so we don't need to carry anything over. But in the elevens place of 6A, we have to add 1 to 6 to get 7, so we write down 7 in the elevens place:\n\n```\n  80\n+ 6A\n----\n  7A\n```\n\nAnd that's our final answer! In base-11, 80+6A is equal to $\\boxed{7A}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 31 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 1 and A. Since A represents the value of 10 in base-10, we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the carry-over digit (which is 1) to the next digit of 31, which is 3. This gives us 4. \n\nFinally, we add the remaining digit of 7A, which is 7. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n31\n+7A\n---\n\\boxed{AA}\n\nTherefore, 31+7A in base-11 is AA.

This gives us 6. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 7 and 9. This gives us 16. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 5 with a carry of 1. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 10's place. We add the carry from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 10's place, which are 0 and 0. This gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 72+94 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{161}.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Adding 7 and 9 gives us 16, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11. However, since we are working with a 1's place, we only keep the rightmost digit, which is A. Finally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 11's place.

This gives us 16, which is one digit in base-11. We write down the 6 and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 8 and 3, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 12, which is also one digit in base-11. We write down the 2 and carry-over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

To add 87 and 98 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 8. \n\n7 + 8 = 15, which is greater than 10 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 49 and 27 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and 7. This gives us 16, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over to the next digit. \n\nThe carry-over value is 1 (since 16 is one more than 15, which is the largest value that can be represented with a single digit in base-11). We add this carry-over value to the next digit, which is 4 in 49 and 2 in 27. \n\nAdding the carry-over value and the next digits, we get 1+4+2=7.

Then we add the digit 7 to get 10, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 2, which gives us 3.

This gives us 16, which is one digit in base-11. We write down the 6 and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 4 and 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 88 and 36 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 6. \n\n8 + 6 = A (since 8 + 6 = 14 in base-10, which is equal to A in base-11)\n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is A. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens digit. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since 8 + 6 = A, and A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we carry-over 1 to the tens place). \n\n8 + 3 + 1 = C (since 8 + 3 + 1 = 12 in base-10, which is equal to C in base-11)\n\nSo the tens digit of our answer is C. \n\nTherefore, 88 + 36 = \\boxed{CA} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 40 and 89 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 9. This gives us 9, but we need to carry over to the next column since 9 is the highest digit in base-11. \n\nIn the next column, we add 1 (the carried over digit) to 4, which gives us 5. Then we add 8 to 0, which gives us 8. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  40\n+ 89\n----\n 129\n\nBut we need to remember that we're in base-11, so the highest digit is A instead of 9. Therefore, we need to write 129 as 10A9 in base-11.\n\nSo, 40+89 = \\boxed{10A9} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add AA and 39, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 39\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the units digits (A and 9). In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 39\n----\n  9A\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place (the second digit from the right). We have A and 3, which add up to 14 in base-11. 14 is equivalent to 1 ten and 4 ones, so we write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 39\n----\n  9A\n +1\n----\n  A3\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundred elevens place (the third digit from the right). We have 1 (from the carry) and 0, which add up to 1. So the final result is:\n\n```\n  AA\n+ 39\n----\n  9A\n +1\n----\n \\boxed{A3}\n``` \n\nTherefore, AA+39 in base-11 is equal to A3.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 79 and 38 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 8. Since 9+8=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 7 (the units digit of 17) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 7 and 3 (the carried-over 1 plus the digit in the second column from the left). 7+3=10, so we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) and 9. 1+9=10, so we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the final carried-over 1 as the leftmost digit. \n\nTherefore, 79+38=110 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{110}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

These add up to 11, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 7 and 4, and add the carry-over of 1. This gives us 12, which is equal to 10 in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which is just 1.

Since 7+9=16, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down the digit 6 (the units digit of 16) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) plus 6 plus 4. This gives us 11, which is equal to A in base-11.

The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the lemma. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ such that $p_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$ and $\\deg(p_n) \\leq n$ for all $n$. Let $p_n(x) = a_{n,0} + a_{n,1}x + \\cdots + a_{n,n}x^n$.

Thus, we have\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{a_i}{i+1} = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = 1.\\]\nNow, we will show that $a_i = \\binom{n}{i}$.

Since $p_n$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$, it can be written as\n\\[p_n(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i \\binom{x}{i}.\\]\nTherefore, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{a_i}{i+1} &= \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{\\binom{n}{i}}{i+1} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=0}^n \\binom{n+1}{i+1} \\frac{1}{n+1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n+1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \\binom{n+1}{i} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n+1} \\cdot 2^{n+1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2^n}{n+1}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we have\n\\[\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{a_i}{i+1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2^n}{n+1} = \\boxed{\\infty}.\\]	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 83+5A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 83 and 5A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over from 10 to the next digit is represented by writing 0 and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 5A\n----\n  2D (carry over 1)\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 5, plus the carry-over of 1. This gives us:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 5A\n----\n  2D (carry over 1)\n  14\n```\n\nSince 14 is not a valid digit in base-11, we need to carry over again. We can represent 14 as 1A, so we write down the A and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 5A\n----\n  2D (carry over 1)\n  1A (carry over 1)\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digit in the hundreds place, which is 0, plus the carry-over of 1. This gives us:\n\n```\n  83\n+ 5A\n----\n  2D (carry over 1)\n  1A (carry over 1)\n  1\n```\n\nSo the result of 83+5A in base-11 is $\\boxed{101}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since A represents 10 in base-11, the sum of the units digits is 10+10=1A. We write down the units digit 1 and carry-over the digit A (which represents 1 in the next place value).\n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 9 and 8, and add the carry-over digit of 1. This gives us 9+8+1=12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry-over the digit 1 (which represents 1 in the next place value) and write down the units digit 2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 9A and 8A is 12A, which in base-11 is equivalent to the decimal number 133. \n\n\\boxed{12A} = \\boxed{133}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

However, 16 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry over" the extra digit. In base-11, 16 is equivalent to 1A (since A represents the digit 10). So we write down the digit A in the 10's place, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the 1 that we carried over to the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 9. This gives us 11, which is equivalent to A0 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 29 and 5A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and A. Since A represents the value of 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  29\n+ 5A\n----\n  89\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 2 and 5. This gives us 7.

Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) plus 8 plus 3. This gives us 12, so we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) plus 8.

However, we can only write single digits in each place, so we carry over the 1 to the next column. Now we have:\n\n```\n  95\n+ 6A\n----\n  10F\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the 11s place, which are 9 and 6.

Then, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx &= \\int_0^1 \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} p_n(x) \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 p_n(x) \\, dx \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^n \\frac{a_{n,i}}{i+1} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \\frac{a_{n,i-1}}{i} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \\frac{a_{n,i-1}}{i} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{a_{n,i}}{i+1} + \\frac{a_{n,n+1}}{n+1} \\\\\n&= \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\int_0^1 p_n(x) \\, dx + \\frac{a_{n,n+1}}{n+1}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx + \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_{n,n+1}}{n+1}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince $f$ is continuous, we have $\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 p_n(x) \\, dx$. Thus, we have\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_{n,n+1}}{n+1} = 0.\\]\nTherefore, we have\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 p_n(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx.\\]\nSince $p_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$, we have\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 p_n(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]\nTherefore, we have\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{1+x^n} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 59 and 89 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 9. This gives us 18, which is equal to one group of 11 and 7 left over. We write down the 7 and carry the 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 5 and 8, and we add the carried 1 from the previous column.

Since 9+0=9, we write down 9 as the units digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevenths place, which are 5 and 7. Since 5+7=12, we have to carry over 1 to the next place value. Therefore, we write down 2 as the digit in the elevenths place of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundredths place, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 1. Since 1+1=2, we write down 2 as the digit in the hundredths place of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  59\n+70\n---\n 129\n\nTherefore, 59+70 in base-11 is \\boxed{129}.

A represents the value 10 in base-10, so in base-11, it represents the value 11. \n\nNext, we can line up the digits and add them as we would in base-10, carrying over to the next place value if the sum is greater than 10. \n\n```\n  65\n+ 5A\n----\n  CA\n```\n\nHowever, we need to remember that in base-11, we only have digits up to A. So if we have a sum greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next place value and subtract 11. \n\nIn this case, we have a sum of CA, which is 12A in base-10. We can carry over the 1 to the next place value and subtract 11 from the 2A to get 1. \n\n```\n  65\n+ 5A\n----\n  1C1\n```\n\nTherefore, 65+5A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1C1}.

To add 7A and 83 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n  7A\n+ 83\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 3.

In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 59\n----\n   9\n```\n\nThe result of adding A and 9 is 9, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 9 is the largest digit in base-11. The value of 1 in 1A represents 11 in base-10, so we need to add 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 59\n----\n  19\n```\n\nNow we can add the next digits, which are 1 and 5:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 59\n----\n  19\n +5\n----\n```\n\nThe result of adding 1 and 5 is 6, so we have:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 59\n----\n  19\n  6\n----\n```\n\nTherefore, 1A+59=196 in base-11, or $\\boxed{196}$ in base-10.

The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the statement. Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.

Let $p_{n+1}(x)$ be the unique polynomial of degree at most $n+1$ that passes through the points $(x_i,f(x_i))$ for $i=0,1,\\ldots,n$. Then $p_{n+1}(x)$ is a polynomial that interpolates $f$ at $n+1$ points, so by the interpolation error formula, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(x)-p_{n+1}(x)| &= \\left|\\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)(x-x_1)\\cdots(x-x_n)\\right| \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{M}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)(x-x_1)\\cdots(x-x_n)\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $M$ is an upper bound for $|f^{(n+1)}(x)|$ on $[0,1]$. Since $x_0=0$ and $x_n=1$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(x)-p_{n+1}(x)| &\\leq \\frac{M}{(n+1)!}x(x-\\frac{1}{n+1})\\cdots(x-1) \\\\\n&\\leq \\frac{M}{(n+1)!}x^n\n\\end{align*}\nfor all $x \\in [0,1]$.

To add 56 and AA in base-11, we first need to convert AA to its decimal equivalent. \n\nAA in base-11 represents 10*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 121 in base-10. \n\nNow we can add 56 and 121 in base-10: \n\n56 + 121 = 177 \n\nFinally, we need to convert 177 back to base-11: \n\n177 = 16*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 16A \n\nTherefore, 56+AA in base-11 is \\boxed{16A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 35 and 16 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 6. Since 5+6=11, we write down 1 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 3. 1+3=4, so we write down 4 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 35+16=41 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{41}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 87 and 51 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 1. This gives us 8, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right. We have 8 from the previous step, plus 1 from the 87 and 5 from the 51. This gives us a total of 14, which is written as "A" in base-11. We write down "A" as the next digit in our answer, to the left of the 8. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 5 (since we carried over a 1 from the previous step). This gives us 5, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nTherefore, 87+51 in base-11 is \\boxed{A5}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 45 and 46 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 6. \n\n5 + 6 = A (since 5 + 6 = 11 in base-10, which is represented by A in base-11)\n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is A. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since 5 + 6 = 11) to the digits in the 10's place: \n\n4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \n\nSo the digit in the 10's place of our answer is 9. \n\nTherefore, 45 + 46 = \\boxed{9A} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 39 and 13 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 3. This gives us 12, which is equal to 1 ten and 2 ones. Since we are in base-11, we can only have up to 10 ones before we need to regroup and exchange them for a ten. Therefore, we write down the 2 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 3 and 1 (the carried-over ten). This gives us 4. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 1 and 0 (since there is no carried-over ten).

A + 2 = B (since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10). So, we write down the digit B and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 7 and 7. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 8. So, we write down the digit 8 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 1. So, we write down the digit 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  7A\n+ 72\n----\n  8B1\n\nTherefore, 7A+72 = \\boxed{8B1} in base-11.

To add 56 and 84 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 4. \n\n6 + 4 = A (since 6 + 4 = 10 in base-10, but we are in base-11, so we represent 10 as A)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since 6 + 4 = A, and A represents 11 in base-10), and the digits in the 1's place, which are 5 and 8.\n\n1 + 5 + 8 = E (since 1 + 5 + 8 = 14 in base-10, but we are in base-11, so we represent 10 as A, and 11 as B)\n\nTherefore, 56 + 84 = \\boxed{AE} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 90 and 37 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 7. This gives us 7. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 90 and the 3 in 37. Adding these gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. The sum of the next digits, 1 and 0, is 1. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0, and get 0. Putting it all together, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}1\\\\\n&90\\\\\n+&37\\\\\n\\cline{1-3}\n&127\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 90+37 in base-11 is \\boxed{127}.

This gives us 14, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add 1 (from the carry-over) to 1 (the digit in the tens place of 19) and 5 (the digit in the tens place of 55).

Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the carry-over digit (which is 1) to the next digit of each number. For 81, the next digit is 8, and for 1A, the next digit is 1. Adding 1 and 8 gives us 9. \n\nTherefore, the result of 81+1A in base-11 is 9A. \n\n\\boxed{9A}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  53\n+ 8A\n----\n  DD\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 8, and add 1 for the carry-over from the units place. This gives us:\n\n```\n   53\n+  8A\n-----\n  10D\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digit in the hundreds place, which is 1 (from the carry-over), to get:\n\n```\n   53\n+  8A\n-----\n  10D\n```\n\nTherefore, 53+8A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{10D}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we simply need to add the values of A0 and 39 in base-11. \n\nA0 represents 10*11^1 + 0*11^0 = 110 in base-10. \n\n39 represents 3*11^1 + 9*11^0 = 42 in base-10. \n\nAdding these two values in base-10, we get: \n\n110 + 42 = 152 \n\nNow we need to convert 152 back into base-11. \n\n152 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 13 and a remainder of 9. \n\n13 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2. \n\nSo in base-11, 152 is represented as 12A. \n\nTherefore, A0+39 = 152 in base-10, which is equivalent to \\boxed{12A} in base-11.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Adding 3 and 9 gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1A in base-11. However, since we are carrying over a digit to the next place value, we write down the 2 from 12 and carry over the A to the next place value.

This gives us a sum of 12 in base-10, but we need to carry over the extra digit (1) to the next column. So, the sum of the third digits is actually 3 in base-11 (12 base-10 - 11 base-10 = 1 base-10 = 1 in base-11, plus the carried-over 1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 135 in base-11, or $\\boxed{135}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 34+4A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 34 and 4A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  34\n+ 4A\n----\n  7E\n```\n\nThe sum of the units digits is E, which represents the value 14 in base-10. We carry-over 1 to the next digit, which gives us a total of 8 in the tens digit. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n$$\\boxed{8E}$$\n\nNote that E represents the value 14 in base-10, so the final result is equivalent to 8 times 11 plus 14, which is 102 in base-10.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding values in base-11. \n\nA = 10\n8A = 8(10) = 80\n\nNow we can add 80 and 34 in base-11:\n\n0 + 4 = 4\n8 + 3 = B (carry-over 1)\n1 + A = B (carry-over 1)\n1 + 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, 8A+34 = 1BB in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{1BB}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 65+4A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 65 and 4A in base-11, we first need to convert A to its decimal equivalent. A represents the value 10 in base-10, so in base-11, A represents the value 11. \n\nNow we can add 65 and 4A in base-11:\n\n  65\n+ 4A\n----\n  10F\n\nHowever, we need to convert 10F back to base-10 to get our final answer. F represents the value 5 in base-10, so 10F in base-11 is equal to 6*11 + 5 = 71 in base-10.\n\nTherefore, 65+4A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{71} in base-10.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 28+82? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 28 and 82 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 2. This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 8. This gives us 9. We write down the 9 and do not need to carry-over anything to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carried-over digit) and 2. This gives us 2. We write down the 2.\n\nTherefore, 28+82= \\boxed{A92} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 55 and 4A in base-11, we start by adding the units digit, which is 5 and A. In base-11, A represents the value of 10. So, 5 + A = F, where F represents the value of 15 in base-10.\n\nNext, we add the tens digit, which is 5 and 4. This gives us 9. However, since we are in base-11, we need to check if there is a carry-over from the units digit. In this case, there is a carry-over of 1 from the units digit, so we add it to the sum of the tens digit. This gives us 9 + 1 = A.\n\nTherefore, 55 + 4A = AF in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{AF}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 ten and 4 units. We write down the 4 units and carry the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 2 and 4 (plus the carried-over 1). This gives us 7. We write down the 7 in the tens column. \n\nTherefore, 29+45 in base-11 is equal to 74. \n\n\\boxed{74}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 71 and 56 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 6. This gives us 7, which we write down as the rightmost digit of the result. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 7 and 5, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones in base-11. We write down the 2 as the digit in the 10's place of the result, and carry-over the 1 to the next step. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 11's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 0 and 1, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 1 in this case). This gives us 2, which we write down as the leftmost digit of the result. \n\nTherefore, 71+56 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{202}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  95\n+ 1A\n----\n  A5\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 9 and 1. We also need to add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  95\n+ 1A\n----\n  A5\n+  1\n----\n  B6\n```\n\nTherefore, 95+1A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{B6}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 6 and 7. Adding these gives us 13, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next digit, which is the 11's place. \n\nIn the 11's place, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 6 and 7 (from the original numbers).

To add 6A and 70 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ 70\n---\n```\n\nSince A is the equivalent of 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next digit when the sum is greater than or equal to 11. Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:\n\n```\n  6A\n+ 70\n---\n  1A\n```\n\nWe carry over 1 to the next digit, and add it to 6:\n\n```\n   1\n  6A\n+ 70\n---\n  80\n```\n\nFinally, we add the remaining digits:\n\n```\n   1\n  6A\n+ 70\n---\n  80\n\\boxed{81}\n```\n\nTherefore, 6A+70 in base-11 is equal to 81.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 88+89? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 88 and 89 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 9. In base-11, 8+9=17, which is one digit with a carry-over of 1. Therefore, we write down the digit 7 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are both 8. We also add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-11, 8+8+1=17, which is one digit with a carry-over of 1. Therefore, we write down the digit 7 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0. We also add the carry-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. In base-11, 0+0+1=1.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 39+19? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 39 and 19 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and 9. This gives us 18, which is equal to one group of 11 and 7 left over. We write down the 7 in the units place and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the 1s digits, which are 3 and 1, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 5.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 63 and 56 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 6. Since 3+6=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11, we have to carry-over 1 to the next place value (the 11's place), and write down the remainder, which is A (since A represents the value 10 in base-11). \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 11's place, which are 0 and 1. Since 0+1+1=2, we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 63+56=2A9 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{2A9}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 ten and 4 ones. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are A and 3, along with the carried-over 1. A+3 is equal to D (since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10), and adding 1 gives us E. \n\nTherefore, the sum of A7 and 37 in base-11 is E4. \n\n\\boxed{E4}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 ten and 4 units in base-11. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 6 and 3, and we also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 10, which is equal to 1 hundred and 0 tens in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and we also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 1 hundred and 0 tens in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 67+37=104 in base-11, which we write as \\boxed{104}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 7+8=15, which is written as "13" (since we carry-over 1 to the next digit). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column to the left, which are 5 and 6, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. In base-11, 5+6+1=12, which is written as "10" (since we carry-over 1 to the next digit). \n\nTherefore, 57+68 in base-11 is equal to "100", which we write as $\\boxed{100}$.

To add A1 and 52 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 52\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding 1 and 2, which gives us 3. In base-11, 3 is represented as 3, so we write down 3 and carry-over 1:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 52\n---\n   3\n```\n\nNext, we add A and 5, which gives us 10. In base-11, 10 is represented as A, so we write down A and carry-over 1:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 52\n---\n  A3\n```\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to A, which gives us B. In base-11, B is represented as B, so we write down B:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 52\n---\n B3\n```\n\nTherefore, A1+52 = \\boxed{B3} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 92 and 31 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 1. This gives us 3, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right. We have a 9 and a 3, but we also need to add the "carry" from the previous step, which is 1. So we have 9 + 3 + 1 = A (since A represents 10 in base-11).

To add 87 and 29 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 9. \n\n7 + 9 = 16, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8 and the digit 2: \n\n1 + 8 + 2 = 11, which is also greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column again. \n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8: \n\n1 + 8 = 9. \n\nTherefore, 87 + 29 = 96 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{96}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 90 and 3A in base-11, we start by lining up the digits in the ones place:\n\n```\n  90\n+ 3A\n----\n```\n\nSince A is the equivalent of 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next place value when the sum of the digits in a column is greater than 10. In this case, we add 0 in the ones place and carry over 1 to the elevens place:\n\n```\n  90\n+ 3A\n----\n  A0\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which gives us 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 86 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. Therefore, the units digit of the sum is 0, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 8 and 7. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 16. However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent this as 5 with a carry-over of 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step to the hundreds place digit, which is 1.

This gives us 12, which is equal to 1 ten and 2 ones. Since we are in base-11, we can only have up to 10 ones before we need to regroup and carry over a ten to the next place value. Therefore, we write down the 2 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which are 3 and 4, and we also add the carried-over ten from the previous step. This gives us 17, which is equal to 1 ten and 7 ones. We write down the 7 ones and carry over the 1 ten to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost place value, which is just 1, and we also add the carried-over ten from the previous step.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 5A and 32 in base-11, we first need to convert 32 to base-11. \n\n32 divided by 11 is 2 with a remainder of 10, which we represent as A in base-11. So, 32 in base-11 is represented as 2A. \n\nNow we can add 5A and 2A in base-11. \n\n5A + 2A = 7A \n\nTherefore, 5A + 32 in base-11 is represented as \\boxed{7A}.

To add 92 and 83 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. \n\n2 + 3 = 5, which is represented as "5" in base-11. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the tens place. We add 9 and 8, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). \n\n9 + 8 = 17. In base-11, we represent 17 as "16" (since we only have digits up to A, which represents 10). \n\nHowever, we also have a carry-over from the previous step, so we need to add that: \n\n16 + 1 = 17. In base-11, we represent 17 as "16". \n\nTherefore, the final result is:\n\n92 + 83 = 175 \n\nwhich is represented as \n\n\\boxed{16\\ 5} \n\nin base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 9, which we write down as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the 1 from 87 to the 3 from 32, which gives us 8. But in base-11, 8 is represented by the digit "9", so we write down "9" as the next digit of the sum and carry-over 1 to the next place.\n\nFinally, we add the 1 from the carry-over to the 8 from 87 and the 2 from 32, which gives us 11. But in base-11, 11 is represented by the digit "A", so we write down "A" as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nTherefore, 87+32 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{A9}.

In base-11, A represents the value 10, so 9 + A = 19. However, 19 is greater than 10, so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the units digit of 19, which is 9, and carry over the value of 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the values in the tens digit, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 9. This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. Therefore, the sum of A9 and 9A is:\n\n\\boxed{A9 + 9A = BA}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 76 and 69 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 9. \n\n6 + 9 = F (since F represents 15 in base-10, which is the sum of 6 and 9 in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1, since F represents 15 and 15 is greater than 11) to the digits in the 10's place.\n\n7 + 6 + 1 = 14 = A3 (since A represents 10 and 3 represents 3 in base-11)\n\nTherefore, 76 + 69 = A3F in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{A3F}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 38 and 17 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 7. \n\n8 + 7 = 15 \n\nSince 15 is greater than 10 (represented by the digit A), we need to carry over to the next column. We carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 5. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column: \n\n3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \n\nSince 5 is less than 10, we write it down in the next column. \n\nTherefore, 38 + 17 in base-11 is equal to 55. \n\n\\boxed{55}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 58 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 8. In base-11, 5+8=D (since A=10, B=11, and C=12, the next digit after 9 is A, and the next digit after A is B, which is represented as 10 in base-11). \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over digit (which is 1 in this case) to the sum of the digits in the 1's place, which are 8 and 5.

This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones. In base-11, we write this as "12", but we need to carry the ten over to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over ten to the digits 5 and 9. This gives us 14, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 4 ones. In base-11, we write this as "14". \n\nTherefore, 57+95 in base-11 is equal to 110. We write the final answer as \\boxed{110}.

A + 6 = 10, which is equal to A in base-11 (since we only have one-digit numbers). We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 7 and 6 (plus the carried-over 1). 7 + 6 + 1 = 14, which is equal to 13 in base-11. We write down the 3 and carry-over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which is just the carried-over 1. We write down the 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  7A\n+ 66\n---\n  13A\n\nTherefore, 7A+66 = \\boxed{13A} in base-11.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 56 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. Therefore, the units digit of our result is 0, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 5 and 7. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 13. However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent this as 1A (1 ten and A units). Therefore, the elevens digit of our result is A, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry-over from the previous step to the hundreds digit, which is 0. We get 1, so the hundreds digit of our result is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  56\n+ 7A\n----\n  100\n\nTherefore, 56+7A in base-11 is \\boxed{100}.

To add 32 and 83 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. \n\n2 + 3 = 5 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 5. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the 1's place digits, which are 3 and 8, and also include the carry from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). \n\n3 + 8 + 0 = 11 \n\nSince we are in base-11, we can't write "11" as a digit. Instead, we write it as "A", which represents the value of 10 in base-10.

This gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 5 and 9, and add the carry-over of 1 from the previous column. This gives us 15, which is equal to 16 in base-10. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to write this as 4 with a carry-over of 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over of 1 from the previous column.

To add A2 and 81, we need to line up the digits in the ones place and the elevens place. \n\nStarting with the ones place, we have 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nMoving on to the elevens place, we have A + 8 = 12. Since we are in base-11, we need to regroup. 12 is one group of 11 with 1 left over, which we represent as "10" in base-11. So, A + 8 = 10 in base-11. \n\nNow we can add the digits in the elevens place: 1 + A = B (remember that A represents 10 in base-11). \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  A2\n+ 81\n---\n  B3\n\nTherefore, A2+81 = \\boxed{B3}.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over to the next digit. 11 in base-11 is represented as "A", so we write down "A" in the second digit and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we have 1+0+0=1 in the leftmost digit. Putting it all together, we get:\n\n  20\n+ 90\n----\n  B0\n\nTherefore, 20+90 in base-11 is equal to $\\boxed{\\text{B0}}$.

Since 1+2=3, we write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nMoving on to the next digit from the right, we have 7 and 4. Since 7+4=11, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. We write down the digit 0 as the second digit from the right of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nAdding the next digits, we have 1, 1, and the carried-over 1. 1+1+1=3, so we write down 3 as the third digit from the right of the sum. \n\nTherefore, 71+42=110 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{110}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 34+5A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 34 and 5A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  34\n+ 5A\n----\n  (4+10) carry-over\n```\n\nThe carry-over adds 1 to the next digit, which is the 1's digit in this case. So we write down the remainder of 4+10 in the units digit, which is E (since E represents the value 14 in base-10), and carry-over 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n  34\n+ 5A\n----\n   E 1\n```\n\nNow we add the digits in the tens place, which are 3 and 5. This gives us 8, but we need to add the carry-over from the previous step. So we have:\n\n```\n  34\n+ 5A\n----\n  8E 1\n```\n\nTherefore, 34+5A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{8E1}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 62 and 85 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 5. This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 6 and 8. This gives us 14. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 1A (since 10 in base-11 is represented by the digit A). \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 10's place, which are 0 and 5. This gives us 6. \n\nTherefore, 62+85 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{7A6}.

This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 91 and the 2 in 26. Adding these gives us 11, which is equal to one group of 11 in base-10. In base-11, we represent this group of 11 as "A". \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried over the "A" from the previous step). This gives us 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  91\n+26\n---\n  A71\n\nTherefore, 91+26 in base-11 is \\boxed{A71}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 73 and 66 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 6. \n\n3 + 6 = 9 \n\nSo the rightmost digit of our answer is 9. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 7 and 6, and also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). \n\n7 + 6 + 0 = 13 \n\nSince 13 is greater than 10, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next place value. So the digit in the 10's place of our answer is 3, and we carry-over the 1 to the 100's place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 100's place, which are 1 and 0 (from the carry-over). \n\n1 + 0 = 1 \n\nSo the digit in the 100's place of our answer is 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n73 + 66 = 140 \n\nIn base-11, this is written as \\boxed{140}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to first convert A1 to base-10. \n\nA1 in base-11 is equal to 10*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 111. \n\nThen, we can simply add 61 to 111: \n\n111 + 61 = 172. \n\nTherefore, A1+61 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{172}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 89 and 84 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 4. Since 9+4=13, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 13 is one more than the largest digit A in base-11). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 8 (since we carried-over the 1 from the previous step). 8+8=16, which is one more than the largest digit A in base-11. So, we write down the digit 6 and carry-over the digit 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit 1 to the leftmost digit 1, which gives us 2. \n\nTherefore, 89+84=172 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{172}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 6+5=11, we carry-over the 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 0. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 and 4 (the digit 1 was carried over from the previous step). 1+4=5, so we write down 5 in the second column.\n\nTherefore, 46+15=51 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{51}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 2+8=A, so we write down A and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 2 (plus the carried-over 1). In base-11, 6+2+1=9, so we write down 9 and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which is just the carried-over 1. In base-11, 1+0+0=1, so we write down 1. \n\nTherefore, 62+28=91 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{91}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 57 and 19 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 9. \n\n7 + 9 = 16 \n\nSince 16 is greater than 10 (represented by the digit A in base-11), we need to carry over to the next place value. We can do this by dividing 16 by 11 and keeping the remainder: \n\n16 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 5 \n\nSo the digit in the units place is 5, and we carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value: \n\n5 + 5 + 1 = 11 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next place value: \n\n11 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 0 \n\nSo the digit in the elevens place is 0, and we carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the next place value: \n\n1 + 1 = 2 \n\nSo the final result is 26 in base-11: \n\n\\boxed{26}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 32 and 99 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 9. \n\n2 + 9 = A (since 2 + 9 = 11 in base-10, which is represented by "A" in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the "1s" digit in base-11. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits 3 and 9. \n\n1 + 3 + 9 = D (since 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 in base-10, which is represented by "D" in base-11)\n\nTherefore, 32 + 99 = AD in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{AD}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A5 and 52 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n A 5\n+  5 2\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the rightmost digits, which gives us 5+2=7:\n\n```\n A 5\n+  5 2\n-----\n    7\n```\n\nNext, we move to the next digit to the left. Here we have 5+5=10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A and carry-over the 1 to the next digit:\n\n```\n A 5\n+  5 2\n-----\n A 7\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which gives us A+0=A:\n\n```\n A 5\n+  5 2\n-----\nA 7 A\n```\n\nTherefore, A5+52 in base-11 is equal to $\\boxed{A7A}$.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 59 and 36 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and 6. This gives us 15, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 5 units in base-11. We write down the 5 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 5 and 3 (remembering to add the carried 1).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A3 and 91 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 9 1\n-----\n```\n\nWe can see that 3 + 1 = 4, so we write down 4 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 9 1\n-----\n    4\n```\n\nNext, we add A and 9. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 9 1\n-----\n  10 4\n```\n\nFinally, we have to carry over the 1 from the tens place. Adding 1 to 10 gives us 11, which in base-11 is written as "10". So we write down "10" in the tens place:\n\n```\n  A 3\n+ 9 1\n-----\n  10 4\n```\n\nTherefore, A3+91 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{104}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 45 and 88 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 8. \n\n5 + 8 = D (since D is the digit that comes after 9 in base-11)\n\nSo, we write down the digit D and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carry-over) and 4. \n\n1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, we write down the digit 5 in the second column from the right. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (since there is no carry-over from the previous column) and 8. \n\n0 + 8 = 8\n\nSo, we write down the digit 8 in the third column from the right. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{DD5}\n\nTherefore, 45+88 in base-11 is \\boxed{DD5}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 84 and 48 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. This gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8, which gives us 9. Then we add the digit 4, which gives us 13. Again, this is greater than 10 in base-11, so we carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the last column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8, which gives us 9.

To add A6 and 61 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n A6\n+61\n---\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the ones place, which gives us 6+1=7:\n\n```\n A6\n+61\n---\n  7\n```\n\nNext, we move to the elevens place. A6 represents 10*11 + 6, so we can add 10 to the 6 to get 16. Then we add the 1 from the 61:\n\n```\n A6\n+61\n---\n  7\n  H\n```\n\nHere, we write H to represent the digit 1 followed by a carry-over to the next place value. Moving to the 121s place, we have A6 = 10*121 + 6, so we add 10 to the 6 to get 16, and then add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n```\n A6\n+61\n---\n  7\n  H\n  1\n```\n\nFinally, we have the 1331s place.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert A6 to base-10. A in base-11 is equal to 10 in base-10, so A6 is equal to 10*11^1 + 6*11^0 = 116 in base-10. \n\nNext, we add 10+A6 in base-10: 10 + 116 = 126. \n\nFinally, we convert 126 back to base-11. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 126 is 11^2, which is equal to 121. Therefore, the first digit in our base-11 representation is 1. \n\nWe subtract 121 from 126 to get 5, which is the second digit in our base-11 representation. \n\nTherefore, 10+A6 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{15}.

Since 9+8=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  39\n +88\n----\n 167\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 3 (the 1 is from carrying over). 1+3=4, so we write down 4 in the second column from the right. \n\n```\n  39\n +88\n----\n  67\n  4\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 0 (since there is no carry-over from the previous column). 0+0=0, so we write down 0 in the leftmost column. \n\n```\n  39\n +88\n----\n  67\n  4\n  0\n```\n\nTherefore, 39+88 in base-11 is equal to $\\boxed{704}$.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 69 and 4A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and A. Since A represents the value of 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit, which is the 11's digit. \n\nThe 11's digit in 69 is 6, and we add the carry-over from the units digit to get 6+1=7. \n\nTherefore, the result of 69+4A in base-11 is 7A. \n\n\\boxed{7A}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 16+88? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 16 and 88 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 8. Since 6+8=14, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 1, which gives us 2. \n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we add the digits 0 and 8, which gives us 8. \n\nTherefore, 16+88=102 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 13 and 67 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 7. Since 3+7=10, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 1 and 6 (the carried-over digit plus the digit in the tens place). 1+6=7, so we write down the digit 7 in the second column. \n\nTherefore, 13+67=80 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{80}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 39 and 43 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 9 and 3. This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 units in base-11. We write down the 2 units and carry over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, which are 3 and 4, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 8. We write down the 8 in the tens column. \n\nTherefore, 39+43=82 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{82}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 65 and 52 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 2. This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry from the previous step (which is 0 in this case) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 6 and 5. This gives us 11 in base-10, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down the A in the 1's place and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the carry from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits in the 11's place, which are 6 and 5. This gives us 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11. We write down the 2 in the 11's place and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we have our final answer: \n\n65 + 52 = \\boxed{A72} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 39 and 74 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 4. This gives us 13, which is equal to 1 ten and 3 ones. We write down the 3 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 3 and 7, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 11, which is equal to 1 ten and 1 one. We write down the 1 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 and 0, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 2. \n\nTherefore, 39+74=112 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{112}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 16 and 29 in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 9. Since 6+9=15, we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the digit 1 (since 15 is one more than the largest digit A in base-11). \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 1 and 2 (the digit 1 was carried-over from the units place). 1+2+1=4, so we write down the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nTherefore, 16+29=45 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{45}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 82 and 73 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. In base-11, 2+3=5, so we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 82 and the 7 in 73. In base-11, 8+7=15, which is greater than 10. Therefore, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next column. In base-11, 15 is written as "14A", where the "A" represents the digit 10. So we write down "A" as the digit in the second column of the sum, and carry over the "1" to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are the carried-over "1" from the previous step and the "0" in 82. In base-11, 1+0=1, so we write down "1" as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{1A5}\n\nTherefore, 82+73=1A5 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 89 and 60 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 0. Since 9+0=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 89 and the 6 in 60. 8+6=14, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. So we write down the digit A (which represents 10 in base-11) as the second digit from the right of the sum, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 0. 1+0=1, so we write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{A0}9\n\nTherefore, 89+60 in base-11 is \\boxed{A0}9.

To add A8 and 43 in base-11, we start by lining up the digits:\n\n```\n A 8\n+ 4 3\n-----\n```\n\nWe start with the ones place, which is 8+3= B (since 8+3=11, and B represents 11 in base-11). We write down the B in the ones place and carry-over the 1 to the elevens place:\n\n```\n A 8\n+ 4 3\n-----\n  1 B\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which is A+4= E (since A+4=15, and E represents 15 in base-11). We write down the E in the elevens place and carry-over the 1 to the 121s place:\n\n```\n A 8\n+ 4 3\n-----\n  1 E\n  1\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we can write down the final result as:\n\n```\n A 8\n+ 4 3\n-----\n  1 E B\n```\n\nTherefore, A8+43 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1EB}.

This gives us 9, which we write down as the rightmost digit of our answer. \n\nNext, we move on to the next digits from the right, which are 9 and 8. Adding these gives us 17, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. We write down the rightmost digit of 17, which is 7, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (since we carried over the 1 from the previous step). This gives us 1, which we write down as the leftmost digit of our answer. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{174}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add A1 and 91 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 91\n---\n```\n\nWe can see that 1 + 1 = 2, so we write 2 in the ones place:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 91\n---\n  2\n```\n\nNext, we add the digit in the 11s place. A + 9 = 13, which is one digit in base-11, so we write 3 in the 11s place and carry-over 1 to the 121s place:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 91\n---\n 32\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digit in the 121s place. 1 + 1 = 2, so we write 2 in the 121s place:\n\n```\n  A1\n+ 91\n---\n232\n```\n\nTherefore, A1+91 = \\boxed{232} in base-11.

Since 9+8=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down 7 as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second place from the right, which are 9 and 3 (the carried-over 1 is added to the 9). 9+3+1=13, which is also greater than 10, so we carry over 1 to the next digit again. We write down 3 as the second digit from the right of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) and 0. 1+0+1=2, so we write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nTherefore, 99+38=137 in base-11, which we write as \\boxed{137}.

This gives us 3. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the digits in this place, which are 3 and 9, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 0. This gives us 12. However, in base-11, we cannot have a digit greater than 9, so we need to "carry-over" the extra digit to the next place. In this case, we carry-over 1 to the next place.\n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, which is the 11's place, we add the digits in this place, which are 1 and 0, and we also add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1.

Adding these gives us 11, which is one group of 11. We write down the "1" in the next digit from the right, and carry the "1" over to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried "1" to the 7 in 70 and the 0 in 49.

Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n```\n  53\n+ 6A\n----\n  C3\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 5 and 6, plus the carry-over from the units place, which is 1.

This gives us 5. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add 7 and 9, which gives us 16. However, 16 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to "carry over" the extra digit. In base-11, 16 is equivalent to 1A, so we write down the A and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0.

We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. Here, we have 3 and 7. Adding these gives us 10, which is equal to A in base-11. However, we cannot write A in the 1's place, so we carry over the 1 to the next digit, which is the 11's place. Here, we have 1 and 7. Adding these with the carried over 1 gives us 9.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 9A+18? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, we need to convert 9A to base-10. A in base-11 is equal to 10 in base-10, so 9A in base-11 is equal to 9*11 + 10 = 109 in base-10. \n\nNext, we can simply add 109 and 18 in base-10 to get 127. \n\nFinally, we need to convert 127 back to base-11. 127 divided by 11 is 11 with a remainder of 6, so the rightmost digit is 6. We then divide 11 by 11 to get 1 with a remainder of 0, so the next digit is 0. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{60A}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

A + 4 = E (since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10). So, we write down E and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the next digits to the left, which are 7 and 2 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step plus 2). 7 + 2 + 1 = A (since 7 + 2 = 9, and A is equivalent to 10 in base-10). So, we write down A and carry-over 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digit, which is 1 (the carried-over 1 from the previous step). 1 + 0 = 1.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 28+7A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 28 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 8 and A. Since A represents the value of 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the carry-over digit (1) to the tens digit (2) and the other addend's tens digit (7), which gives us 10 in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry-over the 1 to the hundreds digit.\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits (1 and 0) and the carry-over digit (1), which gives us 2 in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 28+7A in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{20A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 95 and 32 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 2. This gives us 7. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. We add 9 (from 95) and 3 (from 32), and we get 12. However, 12 is not a valid digit in base-11, so we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nMoving to the leftmost digit, which is the 100's place, we add 1 (from the carry-over) to 1 (from 9+3), and we get 2. \n\nTherefore, 95+32 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{72}.

This gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8, which gives us 9. Then we add the digit 4, which gives us 13. Again, this is greater than 10 in base-11, so we carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the last column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 8, which gives us 9.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over to the next place value. 11 in base-11 is represented by the digit A, so we write down A as the next digit of the sum. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 10's place.

To add A4 and 82 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n A 4\n+  8 2\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 2. In base-11, 4+2=6, so we write down 6 and carry-over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n A 4\n+  8 2\n-----\n    6\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are A and 8, plus the carry-over from the previous column, which is 1. In base-11, A+8+1=13, which is equivalent to 1 carry-over and 2 in the current column.

In base-11, each digit represents a power of 11. The rightmost digit represents 11^0 (which is 1), the next digit to the left represents 11^1 (which is 11), the next digit to the left represents 11^2 (which is 121), and so on.\n\nSo, let's break down the number 26+A4 in base-11:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 4, which represents 4*11^0 = 4*1 = 4.\n- The next digit to the left is A, which represents 10*11^1 = 110.\n- The next digit to the left is 6, which represents 6*11^2 = 726.\n\nAdding these up, we get:\n\n4 + 110 + 726 = 840\n\nTherefore, 26+A4 in base-11 is \\boxed{840}.

So we write down the 5 in the 1's place of our answer, and carry over the 1 ten to the next place value. \n\nFinally, we add the 1 ten from the previous step to the 7 from 74, and the 9 from 95. This gives us a total of 17, which is equivalent to 1 eleven and 6 ones in base-10. We write down the 6 in the 11's place of our answer, and carry over the 1 eleven to the next place value. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, our final answer is $\\boxed{16A}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 49+64? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 49 and 64 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 4. This gives us 13, which is equal to 1 ten and 3 ones. We write down the 3 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 9. Adding these gives us 10, which is equal to 1 ten and 0 ones. We write down the 0 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over digit) and 6. Adding these gives us 7. \n\nSo the final result is 73 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{73}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 27+55? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 27 and 55 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 5. \n\n7 + 5 = C (since C is the digit that represents 12 in base-11)\n\nNext, we move to the next digit to the left, which is the 1's digit. We add the carry (which is 1) to 2, and get 3. \n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0's. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n27\n+ 55\n----\n82\n\nTherefore, 27+55= \\boxed{82} in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 57+15? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 57 and 15 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 5. This gives us 12, which is greater than 10 in base-11. Therefore, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit 5, which gives us 6. Then we add the digit 1 to the digit 1 in the next column, which gives us 2. Finally, we add the digit 0 in the leftmost column to the carried-over 1, which gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 57+15 in base-11 is equal to 62A. \n\n\\boxed{62A}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 6A+45? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to first convert the base-11 numbers to base-10 numbers. \n\nWe know that A represents the value 10 in base-10, so we can rewrite the expression as: \n\n6(10) + 45 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n60 + 45 = 105 \n\nNow we need to convert this back to base-11. \n\n105 divided by 11 gives us a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 6. \n\nThe remainder of 6 corresponds to the digit 6 in base-11. \n\nSo the final answer is: \n\n\\boxed{96}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 65+73? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 65 and 73 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 3. This gives us 8. \n\nNext, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 1's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case) to the digits in the 1's place, which are 6 and 7. This gives us 13. However, since we are in base-11, we need to regroup this as 1A (since A represents the digit 10 in base-11), and carry-over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit, which is the 10's place. We add the carry-over from the previous step (which is 1 in this case) to the digits in the 10's place, which are 0 and 0. This gives us 1. \n\nTherefore, 65+73 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{18A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to convert the letters to their corresponding values in base-11. \n\nA = 10 \n\nNow we can add the numbers: \n\n16 + A8 = 16 + 10*11 + 8 \n\n= 16 + 110 + 8 \n\n= 134 \n\nTherefore, 16+A8 in base-11 is \\boxed{134}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to understand the value of each digit in base-11. \n\nIn base-11, the digit "A" represents the value of 10. Therefore, we can rewrite 56+A0 as 56+10+0. \n\nAdding 56 and 10, we get 66. \n\nTherefore, 56+A0 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{66}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 91+60? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 91 and 60 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 0. This gives us 1. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 91 and the 6 in 60. Adding these gives us 15, which is equivalent to the digit A in base-11. Therefore, we write down A as the second digit from the right. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0, and then add 1 to the result since we carried over a digit in the previous step. This gives us 2. Therefore, the result of 91+60 in base-11 is \\boxed{A2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 1A+94? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 1A and 94 in base-11, we start by aligning the digits:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 94\n----\n```\n\nWe can start by adding the least significant digits, which are A and 4. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 94\n----\n   E\n```\n\nThe sum of A and 4 is E in base-11. We write down the E and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNext, we add the next least significant digits, which are 1 and 9, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 94\n----\n  10E\n```\n\nThe sum of 1, 9, and 1 is 11, which is represented as 10E in base-11. We write down the E and carry-over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the most significant digits, which are 0 and 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 94\n----\n  10F\n```\n\nThe sum of 0, 0, and 1 is 1, which is represented as 1 in base-11. We write down the 1 to get the final result:\n\n```\n1A + 94 = 10F\n```\n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{10F}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A1+4A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To solve this problem, we need to first convert A1 and 4A into base-10 numbers. \n\nA1 in base-11 is equal to 10 (since A represents the value 10 in base-10) plus 1, which gives us 11. \n\n4A in base-11 is equal to 4 times 11 (the value of A in base-10) plus 10 (the value of 1 in base-10), which gives us 54. \n\nNow we can add 11 and 54 in base-10 to get 65. \n\nFinally, we need to convert 65 back into base-11. 65 divided by 11 gives us a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 10, which corresponds to the digit A.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 75+50? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 75 and 50 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 5 and 0. This gives us 5. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 10's place. 7+5=12, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next digit. So we write down 2 in the 10's place and carry over the 1. Finally, we add the carried over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 1+0+1=2. Therefore, 75+50=125 in base-11. \n\n\\boxed{125}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
