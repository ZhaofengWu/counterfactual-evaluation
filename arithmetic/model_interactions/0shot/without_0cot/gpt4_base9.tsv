In base-9, the number 72 is represented as 8*9^0 + 7*9^1 = 8 + 63 = 71 in base-10. Similarly, the number 81 is represented as 1*9^0 + 8*9^1 = 1 + 72 = 73 in base-10. Adding these two base-10 numbers, we get 71 + 73 = 144.\n\nNow, we need to convert 144 back to base-9. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 144 by 9: 144 \xf7 9 = 16 with a remainder of 0. So, the digit in the 9^0 place is 0.\n2. Divide the quotient (16) by 9: 16 \xf7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 7. So, the digit in the 9^1 place is 7.\n3.

So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  73\n+18\n-----\n  2\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 7+1+1 (the carry-over) = 9 in base-10. However, since we are in base-9, 9 is represented as 10. So, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  73\n+18\n-----\n 02\n```\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1:\n\n```\n  73\n+18\n-----\n102\n```\n\nSo, 73+18 in base-9 is equal to 102 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{102}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-10, this would be 16, but in base-9, we need to carry over. So, 16 in base-9 is represented as 17 (since 1 * 9^1 + 7 * 9^0 = 16 in base-10). Therefore, we carry over the 1 and write down the 7:\n\n```\n 1\n  82\n+85\n-----\n 17\n```\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{167}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 17+88? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, the number 17 is represented as 1*9^1 + 7*9^0 = 9 + 7 = 16 in base-10. The number 88 is represented as 8*9^1 + 8*9^0 = 72 + 8 = 80 in base-10. Adding these two numbers together in base-10 gives us 16 + 80 = 96. \n\nNow, we need to convert 96 back to base-9. \n\n96 \xf7 9 = 10 R 6, so 96 = 10*9^1 + 6*9^0. Since 10 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value:\n\n10 \xf7 9 = 1 R 1, so 10 = 1*9^1 + 1*9^0.\n\nNow, we can rewrite 96 as 1*9^2 + 1*9^1 + 6*9^0, which in base-9 is represented as 116.\n\nSo, 17+88 in base-9 is \\boxed{116}.

Adding these two numbers together in base-10, we get 14 + 70 = 84.\n\nNow, we need to convert 84 back to base-9. To do this, we find the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 84, which is 9^1 = 9. We can fit 9 into 84 nine times, so the coefficient for the 9^1 term is 9.
