So we start by adding the least significant digits:\n\n```\n  60\n+ 7F\n----\n   F\n```\n\nThe sum of 0 and F is F. Since F is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. Next, we add the next least significant digits, but we need to remember to add 1 to the sum because we carried over from the previous column:\n\n```\n  60\n+ 7F\n----\n  3F\n```\n\nThe sum of 6 and 7 is D, but we carried over 1 from the previous column, so the actual sum is D+1=E. Since E is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. Finally, we add the most significant digits, but we need to remember to add 1 to the sum because we carried over from the previous column:\n\n```\n  60\n+ 7F\n----\n  3F\n+  1\n----\n  40\n```\n\nThe sum of 1 and 6 is 7, but we carried over 1 from the previous column, so the actual sum is 7+1=8. Since 8 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. Therefore, the result is:\n\n$$\\boxed{40}$$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To solve this problem, we simply need to convert the hexadecimal digits to their decimal equivalents, perform the addition, and then convert the result back to hexadecimal. \n\nIn base-16, the digit "4" represents the decimal value 4, and the digit "A" represents the decimal value 10.
