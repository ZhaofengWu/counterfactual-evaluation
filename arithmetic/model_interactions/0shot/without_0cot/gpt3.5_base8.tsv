Then there exists a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ such that $p_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$ and $\\deg(p_n) \\leq n$ for all $n$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe will prove this by induction on $n$. The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the statement. Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. We will construct a polynomial $p_{n+1}$ of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $p_{n+1}(x) = p_n(x) + a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}$, where $a_n$ is a constant to be determined and $x_0$ is a point in $[0,1]$. We want to choose $a_n$ and $x_0$ so that $p_{n+1}$ approximates $f$ better than $p_n$ does. We will choose $x_0$ to be the point in $[0,1]$ where $f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)$ is maximized. Then we will choose $a_n$ to be the slope of the line through $(x_0,f(x_0))$ and $(1,f(1))$. This will ensure that $p_{n+1}$ is a better approximation to $f$ than $p_n$.\n\nTo see why this works, let $g(x) = f(x) - p_n(x)$. Then $g(x_0) \\geq g(x)$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Thus, $g(x_0) \\geq \\max_{x \\in [0,1]} g(x)$. Let $a_n$ be the slope of the line through $(x_0,f(x_0))$ and $(1,f(1))$. Then $p_{n+1}(x) = p_n(x) + a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}$ satisfies $p_{n+1}(x_0) = f(x_0)$ and $p_{n+1}(1) = f(1)$. Moreover, for any $x \\in [0,1]$,\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(x) - p_{n+1}(x)| &= |g(x) - a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&\\leq |g(x)| + |a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&\\leq |g(x_0)| + |a_n(x_0-x)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&= |f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)| + |a_n(x_0-x)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&\\leq |f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)| + |a_n| \\\\\n&\\leq |f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)| + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, if we choose $a_n$ such that $|a_n| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$, then we have $|f(x) - p_{n+1}(x)| < \\epsilon$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, $p_{n+1}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. By induction, we can construct a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ that converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:main}]\nLet $f$ be a continuous function on $[0,1]$. We will show that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$ if and only if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$ and $\\deg(p) \\leq n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n$(\\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. By the definition of uniform continuity, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon$ whenever $|x-y| < \\delta$. Let $n$ be the smallest integer such that $\\frac{1}{2^n} < \\delta$. Then, by the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, there exists a polynomial $p$ of degree at most $n$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$ and $\\deg(p) \\leq n$.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$ and $\\deg(p) \\leq n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. Then there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$.

In base-8, we can add 60 and 57 by adding the digits in each place value, carrying over to the next place value if necessary. \n\nStarting with the ones place, we have:\n\n0 + 7 = 7\n\nMoving to the eights place, we have:\n\n6 + 5 = 13\n\nSince 13 is greater than 7 (the largest digit in base-8), we need to carry over to the next place value. 13 in base-8 is equivalent to 1 eight and 5 ones. So we write down the 5 in the eights place and carry over the 1 to the next place value. \n\nFinally, in the 64s place, we have:\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n60 + 57 = 135\n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{135}$.

To add 51 and 74 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 4. This gives us 5, which we write down as the rightmost digit of the result. Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8's digit. We add the 8's digit of 5 and 7, which gives us 12. Since 12 is greater than 7, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next digit. So we write down the rightmost digit of 12, which is 4, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the 1's digit of 5 and 7, and add the carried-over 1. This gives us 5+7+1=13. Since 13 is greater than 7, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next digit. So we write down the rightmost digit of 13, which is 5, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. However, since there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carried-over 1 as the leftmost digit of the result.

Then there exists a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ such that $p_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$ and $\\deg(p_n) \\leq n$ for all $n$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe will prove this by induction on $n$. The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the statement. Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. We will construct a polynomial $p_{n+1}$ of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $p_{n+1}(x) = p_n(x) + a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}$, where $a_n$ is a constant to be determined and $x_0$ is a point in $[0,1]$. We want to choose $a_n$ and $x_0$ so that $p_{n+1}$ approximates $f$ better than $p_n$ does. We will choose $x_0$ to be the point in $[0,1]$ where $f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)$ is maximized. Then we will choose $a_n$ to be the slope of the line through $(x_0,f(x_0))$ and $(1,f(1))$. This will ensure that $p_{n+1}$ is a better approximation to $f$ than $p_n$.\n\nTo see why this works, let $g(x) = f(x) - p_n(x)$. Then $g(x_0) \\geq g(x)$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Thus, $g(x_0) \\geq \\max_{x \\in [0,1]} g(x)$. Let $a_n$ be the slope of the line through $(x_0,f(x_0))$ and $(1,f(1))$. Then $p_{n+1}(x) = p_n(x) + a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}$ satisfies $p_{n+1}(x_0) = f(x_0)$ and $p_{n+1}(1) = f(1)$. Moreover, for any $x \\in [0,1]$,\n\\begin{align*}\n|f(x) - p_{n+1}(x)| &= |g(x) - a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&\\leq |g(x)| + |a_n(x-x_0)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&\\leq |g(x_0)| + |a_n(x_0-x)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&= |f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)| + |a_n(x_0-x)^{n+1}| \\\\\n&\\leq |f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)| + |a_n| \\\\\n&\\leq |f(x_0) - p_n(x_0)| + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, if we choose $a_n$ such that $|a_n| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$, then we have $|f(x) - p_{n+1}(x)| < \\epsilon$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, $p_{n+1}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. By induction, we can construct a sequence of polynomials $p_n$ that converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0,1]$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:main}]\nLet $f$ be a continuous function on $[0,1]$. We will show that $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$ if and only if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$ and $\\deg(p) \\leq n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n$(\\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. By the definition of uniform continuity, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon$ whenever $|x-y| < \\delta$. Let $n$ be the smallest integer such that $\\frac{1}{2^n} < \\delta$. Then, by the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, there exists a polynomial $p$ of degree at most $n$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$ and $\\deg(p) \\leq n$.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\epsilon$ and $\\deg(p) \\leq n$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. Then there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $\\|f-p\\|_\\infty < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$.

To add 51 and 74 in base-8, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 4. This gives us 5, which we write down as the rightmost digit of the result. Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8's digit. We add the 8's digit of 5 and 7, which gives us 12. Since 12 is greater than 7, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next digit. So we write down the rightmost digit of 12, which is 4, and carry over the 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the 1's digit of 5 and 7, and add the carried-over 1. This gives us 5+7+1=13. Since 13 is greater than 7, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next digit. So we write down the rightmost digit of 13, which is 5, and carry over the 1 to the next digit.

Adding them up, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{=} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\boxed{107}}.
