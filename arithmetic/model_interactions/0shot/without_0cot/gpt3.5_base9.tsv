To add 43 and 86 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 3 and 6. Since 3+6=9, we carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over 1 means subtracting 9 from the sum. So we have:\n\n```\n  43\n+ 86\n----\n  12 (carry over 1)\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 8, and add the carried over digit of 1. We get:\n\n```\n  43\n+ 86\n----\n  12 (carry over 1)\n  1 0\n```\n\nTherefore, 43+86 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{10}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 86+80? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 86 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 0. This gives us 6. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. Here, we have 8 and 8, which add up to 16. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit to the next place value. So we write down 16 as 7 (the remainder when dividing by 9) and carry over 1. Finally, we add the carried over 1 to the next place value, which is the 81's digit. Here, we have 1 and 0, which add up to 1. Adding all these results together, we get:\n\n86\n+ 80\n----\n166\n\nHowever, since we are in base-9, we need to convert this back to base-10 to get the final answer. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nresult = d[n]*9^n + d[n-1]*9^(n-1) + ... + d[1]*9 + d[0]\n\nwhere d[i] is the i-th digit from the right and n is the total number of digits. Applying this formula to our result of 166, we get:\n\nresult = 6*9^0 + 6*9^1 + 1*9^2 = 6 + 54 + 81 = 141\n\nTherefore, 86+80 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{141} in base-10.

In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  78\n +51\n----\n 129\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5, and the digit we carried over, which is 1. We get:\n\n```\n  78\n +51\n----\n 129\n```\n\nSince 7+5+1=13, we carry over a digit to the next place value. Again, in base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n```\n  78\n +51\n----\n 129\n```\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 0 and 0, and the digit we carried over, which is 1.

Then we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 6, and add the carried-over 1, giving us 7+6+1=14. Since 14 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we write down the remainder of 14 divided by 9, which is 5, and carry-over the quotient, which is 1, to the next column.

To add 23 and 83 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 3. This gives us 6, which we write down as the rightmost digit of the result. Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 2 in 23 and the 8 in 83. Adding these gives us 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 1 unit. We write down the unit (which is 1) as the next digit of the result, and carry over the ten to the next column. Finally, we add the carried-over ten to the leftmost digit, which is 2 in this case. This gives us 12 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 3 units. We write down the 3 as the leftmost digit of the result, and carry over the ten to the next column (which doesn't exist in this case, since we've run out of digits).

In base-9, this means that we write down a 2 in the nines place and carry over a 1 to the 81s place. \n\nFinally, we add the 81s digits, which are 0 and 1 (since we carried over a 1 from the nines place). 0+1=1, so we write down a 1 in the 81s place. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n   85\n + 36\n-----\n  121\n\nTherefore, 85+36=121 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{121}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 87 and 32 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+2=10. Since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit, which means that the units digit of our result is 1 and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, along with the carried-over digit from the previous step. This gives us 8+3+1=12. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit, so the tens digit of our result is 2 and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, along with the carried-over digit from the previous step. Since there are no hundreds digits in either number, we simply add the carried-over digit, which gives us 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ } \\\\\n&\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & 1 & 2 & 1 & \\\\\n& & 8 & 7 & & + & 3 & 2 \\\\\n\\cline{4-8}\n& & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & \\\\\n\\end{array} \\\\\n&\\phantom{ } \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 87+32 in base-9 is \\boxed{1021}.

Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9's digit. We add 4 and 8, and we get 12. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit. So we write down 3 as the next digit of our answer, and we carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are both 0, but we need to add the carried-over 1. This gives us 1. So our final answer is 131 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 44+87 = \\boxed{131}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n  7\n +5\n---\n 12\n\nSubtracting 9 from 12 gives us 3, and adding 1 to the next place value gives us 1.

Instead, we use "10" to represent one more than the largest digit, which is "8". \n\nTo add 56 and 57 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits: \n\n6 + 7 = 13 \n\nSince 13 is greater than 8, we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the "3" and carry the "1" to the next column: \n\n5 + 5 + 1 = 11 \n\nAgain, we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the "1" and carry the "1" to the next column: \n\n1 + 1 = 2 \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n56 + 57 = 113 \n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{113}$.

To add 46 and 85 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and 5. Since 6+5=11 in base-10, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, this means that we write down a 2 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the nines place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the nines place, which are 4 and 8, and we add the carried-over digit from the previous step, which is 1. This gives us 4+8+1=13 in base-9. Again, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value, so we write down a 4 in the nines place and carry over a 1 to the 81s place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 81s place, which are 0 and 0, and we add the carried-over digit from the previous step, which is 1.

In base-9, we can add 1+1 to get 2, and 6+7 to get 13. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit when we reach 9. Therefore, we write down 4 (the digit for 13 in base-9) and carry over 1 to the next column. In the next column, we have 1+6+7+1 (the carried over digit) which equals 15. Again, we write down the digit for 15 in base-9, which is 6, and carry over 1 to the next column. Finally, in the last column, we have 1+1 (the carried over digit) which equals 2.

Then we add the digits in the next column, which are 8 and 7, and add the carried-over 1, giving us 8+7+1=16. Since 16 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we write down the units digit 6 and carry-over the 1 to the next column.

To add 87 and 64 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+4=11. Since 11 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next place value. We can represent 11 as 12 in base-9, so we write down the 2 and carry over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, along with the carried-over 1. This gives us 8+6+1=15. Again, we need to carry over to the next place value, so we write down the 5 and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, along with the carried-over 1. Since there are no digits in the hundreds place for either number, we simply write down the 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\\\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ 87 \\\\\n&+ \\ \\ \\ 64 \\\\\n\\cline{1-3}\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ 151 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 87+64=151 in base-9, or $\\boxed{151}$.

In base-9, 7+7=14, which is written as "14" in base-9. However, since we are adding two base-9 numbers, we need to check if there is any carrying involved. In this case, there is a carrying of 1 from the units place to the nines place. So, we write down the 4 in the units place and carry the 1 to the nines place. In the nines place, we have 1+7+7=15, which is written as "16" in base-9 (since 15 is one more than the largest digit in base-9, which is 8).

The next digit in 51 is 5, and the next digit in 68 is 7. Adding these digits along with the carried-over 1 gives us 13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over again. The next digit in 51 is 0 (since we've already carried over from the 5), and the next digit in 68 is 6. Adding these digits along with the carried-over 1 gives us 8.

To add 87 and 70 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 0. Since 7+0=7, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. Next, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 7. Since 8+7=15, we write down 6 as the tens digit of the sum and carry-over 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the carry-over digit (which is 1) to the digit in the hundreds place, which is 0. This gives us 1 as the hundreds digit of the sum.

To add 47 and 62 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+2=9. Since 9 is the largest digit in base-9, we need to carry over to the next place value. We write down the digit 0 and carry over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next place value, which gives us 4+6+1=11. Again, we need to carry over to the next place value, so we write down the digit 2 and carry over the 1. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third place value, which is just the carried-over 1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n&\\quad\\, \\boxed{210}\\\\\n&\\underline{+ 47\\phantom{0}}\\\\\n&\\quad\\, 062\\\\\n&\\phantom{ }\\\\\n\\end{align*}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 85 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7. Since 7 is less than 9, we write down 7 as the units digit of our answer. Next, we add the tens digits, which gives us 16. However, 16 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the sum and adding 1 to the next place value. So we have:\n\n  8  2\n+ 8  5\n-----\n  1  7\nCarry 1\n\nTherefore, 82+85 in base-9 is equal to 17 with a carry of 1, which we can write as $\\boxed{18}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

In base-9, this means that we write down a 2 in the units place and carry over a 1 to the nines place. \n\nNext, we add the nines digits, which are 7 and 4, along with the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us 7+4+1=12 in base-10, which is equivalent to 13 in base-9. We write down a 3 in the nines place and carry over a 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, along with the carried-over digit of 1.

To add 71 and 36 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+6=13. Since 13 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next digit. Specifically, we carry over 1 to the next digit and write down the remainder, which is 13-9=4. Next, we add the digits in the tens place, which gives us 1+3=4.

To add 85 and 78 in base-9, we can start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 8. Since 5+8=13 in base-10, we need to regroup and write 13 as 14-1 in base-9. Therefore, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 and 7 (the digit 1 was carried-over from the previous step). We get 1+7=8 in base-9, so we write down the digit 8 in the next column.\n\nFinally, we have no more digits to add, so the result is 8 in the hundreds place and 4 in the units place.

To add 82 and 13 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. Since 2+3=5, we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 8 in 82 and the 1 in 13. Since 8+1=9, we have to carry over to the next digit. However, in base-9, there is no digit for 9, so we write 0 in the current digit and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 1 in this case, to get 2. Therefore, 82+13=100 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{100}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit, which means that the units digit of our result is 0 and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 7 and 4, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 7+4+1=12. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit, so the digit in this column is 3 and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carried-over 1.

To add 87 and 24 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+4=11. Since 11 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next place value. We can write 11 as 12-1, where 12 is the base and -1 represents the carry. So we write down the digit 1 in the units place and carry over the digit -1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which gives us 8+2=10. Again, we need to carry over to the next place value, so we write down the digit 1 in the tens place and carry over the digit -1 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which gives us 1+0=1. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{ } \\\\\n&\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}}\n& & \\boxed{1} & \\boxed{1} & \\phantom{ } \\\\\n& & & 8 & 7 \\\\\n+ & & & 2 & 4 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n& & 1 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\\\\n&\\phantom{ } \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 87+24 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{113}$.

So we write down the unit digit 0 and carry-over the ten to the next column. In the next column, we add the digits and the carried-over ten, which gives us 6+2+1=9. Since 9 is the largest digit in base-9, we need to regroup the 9 as 1 nine and 0 units. So we write down the unit digit 0 and carry-over the nine to the next column.

To add 88 and 20 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. This gives us 8, but since 8 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to regroup. We can regroup by adding 1 to the next digit to the left and subtracting 9 from the current digit. In this case, we add 1 to the 8 in the tens place and subtract 9 from the 8 in the ones place. This gives us:\n\n  88\n+20\n---\n 108\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 2 (from the 20). This gives us 10, but again, 10 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to regroup. We add 1 to the next digit to the left and subtract 9 from the current digit. This gives us:\n\n  88\n+20\n---\n1108\n\nFinally, we add the digit in the hundreds place, which is 1. This gives us:\n\n  88\n+20\n---\n1108\n\nTherefore, 88+20 in base-9 is \\boxed{1108}.

To add 84 and 61 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 4 and 1. This gives us 5, which we write down as the units digit of our answer. Next, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 8 and 6, and we get 14. However, 14 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over 1 means subtracting 9 from the current digit and adding 1 to the next place value. So we write down 5 as the tens digit of our answer, and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are 1 (from carrying over) and 0 (from 0 in 84). This gives us 1, which we write down as the hundreds digit of our answer.

We write down the digit 6 (which represents 1 ten and 5 ones in base-9) and add it to the sum of the tens digits, which gives us 6+6=12. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we write down the digit 3 (which represents 1 hundred and 3 tens in base-9) and add it to the sum of the hundreds digits, which is 0. Therefore, the final result is 133 in base-9, or \\boxed{133}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

We write down the 5 as the tens digit of the result, and we carry-over the 1 to the next step. Finally, we add the carry-over (which is 1) to the hundreds digits, which are both 0. This gives us 1, which we write down as the hundreds digit of the result. Therefore, 84+73=151 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{151}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 71 and 74 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 1+4=5. Since 5 is less than 9, we write down 5 as the units digit of the sum. Next, we add the tens digits, which gives us 7+7=14. However, 14 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 14, which gives us 5, and then adding 1 to the next place value. So the sum of the tens digits is 5+1=6.

To add 74 and 21 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 4+1=5. We write down the 5 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. In the next column, we have 7+2+1=10. Since we are in base-9, we need to regroup this as 1*9+1. We write down the 1 and carry-over the 1 to the next column. Finally, in the leftmost column, we have 1+0+1=2.

Next, we add the tens digits, which are 8 and 5, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 8+5+1=14, so we write down the tens digit 4 and carry-over the hundreds digit 1. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which are both 0, and add the carry-over from the previous step, which is 1. We get 0+0+1=1, so we write down the hundreds digit 1.

Adding 8 and 1 gives us 10, which is equal to one nine and one unit. We write down the unit (0) and carry the nine over to the next digit. Finally, we add the carried nine to the next digit, which gives us 9+2+1=12. This is equal to one nine and three units, so we write down the unit (3) and carry the nine over to the next digit. Since there are no more digits, we write down the carried nine as the leftmost digit of the result. Therefore, 82+14=100\\boxed{603}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 13 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value. Thus, we have 1 in the units place and 3 in the nines place. Next, we add the digits in the nines place, which gives us 4+7+3=14. Again, we carry-over the extra digit to the next place value, which gives us 1 in the nines place and 4 in the eighty-ones place. Therefore, 48+75=141 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{141}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 85+82? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 85 and 82 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 5+2=7. Since 7 is less than 9, we write down 7 as the units digit of the sum. Next, we add the tens digits, which gives us 8+8=16. However, 16 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to "carry" the extra digit over to the next place value. Specifically, we write down the digit 7 (since 16-9=7) as the tens digit of the sum, and we carry over the digit 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which gives us 1+0=1. Therefore, the sum of 85 and 82 in base-9 is 171. \n\n\\boxed{171}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 85 and 24 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 5+4=8. Since 8 is less than 9, we write down 8 as the units digit of the result. Next, we add the tens digits, which gives us 8+2=10. Since 10 is equal to 1*9+1, we write down 1 as the carry-over digit and 1 as the tens digit of the result. Therefore, 85+24=110 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{110}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 75 and 56 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 5 and 6. Since 5+6=11 in base-10, we need to carry over a digit to the next place value. In base-9, this means that we write down 2 (which is 11 in base-9) and carry over 1 to the next place value. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 5 (remember to include the carry-over digit!). 7+5+1=13 in base-10, which is equivalent to 14 in base-9. We write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0. We don't need to carry over any digits this time.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{0}1\\quad 4\\quad 2\\\\\n&\\underline{+\\quad 7\\quad 5}\\\\\n&\\phantom{0}1\\quad 4\\quad 4\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, 75+56=144 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{144}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 83 and 24 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7. We then move on to the next digit, which is the nines digit. Adding 8 and 2 gives us 10, which is equal to one nine and one unit. We write down the unit (0) and carry the nine over to the next digit. Adding the carried nine to 3 and 2 gives us 14, which is equal to one nine and five units. We write down the five units and carry the one nine over to the next digit. Finally, we add the carried one nine to 8 and 0, which gives us 9. We write down the nine and we are done. Therefore, 83+24=109 in base-9, or $\\boxed{109}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 12+80? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, 12 is equivalent to 13 (1 nine and 3 ones) and 80 is equivalent to 89 (8 nines and 9 ones). Adding these two numbers gives us:\n\n13\n+ 89\n----\n102\n\nHowever, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit that is greater than or equal to 9. Therefore, we need to "carry over" the extra digit to the left, just like in base-10 arithmetic. In this case, we have one extra digit, so we add it to the next column over:\n\n1\n+ 02\n----\n\\boxed{110}\n\nTherefore, 12+80 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{110}.

To add 82 and 43 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 5. We then move on to the next digit, which is the nines digit. Adding 8 and 4 gives us 12, which is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), so we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the remainder, which is 12 mod 9 = 3, and carry over the quotient, which is 12 div 9 = 1. We then add the carried-over quotient to the next digit, which is the 81s digit. Adding 1 and 2 gives us 3. Therefore, 82+43=125 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{125}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra digit, which means that the units digit of our answer is 1 and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the tens digits, along with the carried-over 1, which gives us 8+6+1=15. Again, we need to carry over the extra digit, which means that the tens digit of our answer is 6 and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digits, along with the carried-over 1, which gives us 1+1=2.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 46+50? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, we don't have the digit "9". Instead, we use "10" to represent one more than the largest digit, which is "8". \n\nTo add 46 and 50 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 0. This gives us 6. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the "9's" digit. Here, we have 4 and 5. Adding these gives us 9, which is one more than the largest digit. So we write down "0" in the "9's" place and carry-over the "1" to the next digit. \n\nThe next digit from the right is the "81's" digit. Here, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 4 and 5. This gives us 10, which is two more than the largest digit. So we write down "2" in the "81's" place and carry-over the "1" to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we have the "729's" digit, which is the leftmost digit. Here, we have 1 (from the carry-over) plus 4.

To add 84 and 28 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 4 and 8. Since 4+8=12, we write down the digit 3 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 1 and 8 (the carried-over digit from the previous step plus the digit in the second column of 84). Since 1+8=9, we write down the digit 0 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 (the carried-over digit from the previous step) and 2 (the digit in the third column of 28).

To add 67 and 75 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+5=12. Since 12 is greater than 8 (the largest digit in base-9), we need to carry over to the next digit. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1. Then we add the digits in the tens place, which gives us 6+7+1=14. Again, we need to carry over to the next digit, so we write down the 4 and carry over the 1. Finally, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which gives us 1.

To add 40 and 87 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 0 and 7. This gives us 7 in base-9. Next, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 4 and 8, and we also add any carry-over from the previous step (which is 0 in this case). This gives us 12 in base-9. However, since we are working in base-9, we cannot write the digit "12" as is. Instead, we need to regroup it as 1 ten and 3 ones. So we write down the digit "3" in the tens place and carry-over the digit "1" to the hundreds place. Finally, we add the digit in the hundreds place, which is 1, to the result.

In base-9, we can add 6 and 2 to get 8, and add 6 and 0 to get 6. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over a digit when we reach 9. Thus, we have:\n\n   60\n + 62\n-----\n  122\n\nBut since we are in base-9, we need to convert this back to base-10 to get the final answer. In base-10, 122 is equal to:\n\n1*9^2 + 2*9^1 + 2*9^0 = 81 + 18 + 2 = 101\n\nTherefore, 60+62 = \\boxed{101} in base-9.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 71 and 72 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 1+2=3. Since 3 is less than 9, we write it down as the units digit of the result. Next, we add the tens digits, which gives us 7+7=14. However, 14 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to carry over to the next place value. In base-9, carrying over means subtracting 9 from the current digit and adding 1 to the next place value.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 48+80? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 48 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 0. This gives us 8. We then move to the next digit from the right and add the carry from the previous step (which is 0 in this case) to the digits 4 and 8. This gives us 12 in base-9, but since 12 is not a valid digit in base-9, we need to regroup. We can regroup 12 as 1 group of 9 and 3 ones. So we write down the digit 3 and carry over the 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the carry to the leftmost digits 0 and 8, which gives us 9. Therefore, 48+80 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{93}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 57+53? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, we can add 7 and 3 to get 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit that represents ten. Instead, we carry over the ten to the next place value, which is the 9's place. Thus, we have 1 ten and 2 ones in the ones place, and we carry over the 1 ten to the 9's place. In the 9's place, we have 5 and 5, which add up to 11. Again, we cannot have a digit that represents eleven in base-9, so we carry over the one to the next place value, which is the 81's place. Thus, we have 1 hundred (which is 1 ten times 9) and 1 one in the 81's place, and we have 1 ten and 2 ones in the 9's place. Therefore, 57+53 in base-9 is equal to $\\boxed{1010}$.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 35+74? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, we can add 5 and 4 to get 11, which is equivalent to 1 carry-over and 2 in the ones place. Then we add 1 and 3 (the carry-over) to get 4 in the tens place. Therefore, 35+74=104 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{104}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 67+86? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 67 and 86 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are 7 and 6. Since 7+6=14, we write down the digit 4 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 6 and 8, and add the carry-over digit of 1. We get 6+8+1=15, which is written as the digit 6 and a carry-over digit of 1 to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which is just the carry-over digit of 1. So the final result is 153 in base-9. \n\nTherefore, 67+86 = \\boxed{153}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 37+44? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, we can add 3+4 to get 7 in the units place, and 7+4 to get 11 in the nines place. However, since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the extra 1 to the next place value. Thus, the final result is 111 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{111}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 76+80? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 76 and 80 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 0. This gives us 6. We then move to the next digit from the right, which is the 7 in 76 and the 8 in 80. Adding these gives us 15, which is equivalent to 16 in base-9 (since we are using digits 0-8). We write down the 6 and carry the 1 to the next digit. Adding the next digits, which are the carried 1, the 0 in 76, and the 0 in 80, gives us 1. So the final result is 156 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{156}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 67+60? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, we can add the digits as follows:\n\n7 + 0 = 7\n6 + 6 = 12 (which is equivalent to 1*9 + 3)\nTherefore, 67 + 60 = 127 in base-9.\n\n\\boxed{127}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 67+67? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-9, we can add 6 and 6 to get 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones. We write down the 2 ones and carry over the 1 ten. Then we add the carried-over 1 ten to the two 6's, which gives us 13. However, 13 is not a valid digit in base-9, so we need to write it as 1 ten and 4 ones. Therefore, 67+67=134 in base-9. \n\n\\boxed{134}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 75+81? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 75 and 81 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which are both 5 in base-9. This gives us 10 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 0 ones. We write down the 0 ones and carry the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 7 and 8 in base-9, and we also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 16 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 sixteen and 6 ones. We write down the 6 ones and carry the 1 sixteen to the next column. \n\nIn the next column, we add the digits in the hundreds place, which are both 0 in base-9, and we also add the carried-over 1. This gives us 1 in base-9, which is equivalent to 1 one. We write down the 1 one in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 75+81 in base-9 is equal to 106, which we write as \\boxed{106}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 67+78? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 67 and 78 in base-9, we start by adding the units digits, which gives us 7+8=15. Since 15 is greater than 8, we carry over the 1 to the next place value. Adding the next digits along with the carried-over 1, we get 1+6+7=14. Again, we carry over the 1 to the next place value. Finally, adding the last digits along with the carried-over 1, we get 1+1=2. Therefore, 67+78=214 in base-9. \n\n$\\boxed{214}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 60+88? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 60 and 88 in base-9, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 0 and 8. This gives us 8, but we need to carry over to the next digit since 8 is the largest digit in base-9. So we have 1 carried over and 8 in the ones place. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are 6 and 8, and add the carried-over 1. This gives us 15, but we need to carry over again since 15 is greater than the largest digit in base-9. We carry over 1 to the next digit and write 6 in the tens place. \n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the digit in the hundreds place, which is 0. This gives us 1 in the hundreds place. \n\nTherefore, 60+88 in base-9 is equal to 168. \n\n$\\boxed{168}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
