Converting 52 and 88 to base-10, we get 5*11^1 + 2*11^0 = 57 and 8*11^1 + 8*11^0 = 96, respectively. Adding these two numbers in base-10, we get 57 + 96 = 153. \n\nConverting 153 back to base-11, we have to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 153, which is 11^2 = 121. The quotient when 153 is divided by 121 is 1 with a remainder of 32. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 32 is 11^1 = 11.

To add 92 and 53 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 3. Since 2+3=5, we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the 9 in 92 and the 5 in 53. Since 9+5=14, we write down 4 as the digit in the second position from the right, and carry-over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 and 0 (represented by the letter A in base-11). Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 1+0+1=2, which we write down as the leftmost digit of the sum.

To add 92 and 1A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over from 10 to the next digit is represented by the digit "B".

To add 89 and 47 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 7. Since 9+7=16, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means subtracting 11 from the sum and adding 1 to the next digit. So we have:\n\n9+7=16, which becomes 5 with a carry-over of 1.\n\nNext, we add the carry-over of 1 to the next digit, which is 8. So we have:\n\n8+1=9.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 4. Since 0+4=4, we have:\n\n89+47=136.\n\nTherefore, the result is $\\boxed{136}$.

To add 92 and 6A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and A. Since A represents the value of 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. Thus, the units digit of the sum is 0, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 9 and 6. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 16. Since 16 is greater than 11, we need to carry-over 1 to the next digit. Thus, the elevens digit of the sum is 7, and we carry-over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the 121s place, which are 1 and nothing (since there is no digit in the 121s place of 6A). Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 2. Thus, the 121s digit of the sum is 2. \n\nTherefore, 92+6A = 702 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{702}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 88 and 89 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 8 and 9. Since 8+9=17, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over from 10 to the next digit is represented by the digit "A". So we write down "7" as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry over an "A" to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place, which are both 8. But we also need to add the "A" that we carried over from the ones place. So we have 8+8+A=16+A. Since 16 is greater than 10, we carry over an "A" to the next digit, and write down "6" as the digit in the tens place of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over "A" to the leftmost digit, which is 0. We get A+0=A. \n\nTherefore, 88+89=176 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{176}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

The base case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for some $n$. We will show that it is true for $n+1$. Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the conditions of the statement. Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree at most $n$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$. We will construct a polynomial $p_{n+1}$ of degree at most $n+1$ that approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $x_0=0$, $x_1=\\frac{1}{n+1}$, $x_2=\\frac{2}{n+1}$, $\\ldots$, $x_n=1$. Let $p_{n+1}(x)$ be the polynomial that interpolates $f$ at these points. Then $p_{n+1}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n+1$ and $p_{n+1}(x_i)=f(x_i)$ for all $i$. We will show that $p_{n+1}$ approximates $f$ uniformly on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $\\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, it is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$. Thus, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)| < \\epsilon$ whenever $|x-y| < \\delta$. Let $N$ be a positive integer such that $\\frac{1}{N} < \\delta$. Then, for any $x \\in [0,1]$, there exists an $i$ such that $x \\in [x_i,x_{i+1}]$.

To add 44 and 68 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are both 4 and 8. This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones in base-10. However, since we are working in base-11, we can only have up to 10 ones before we need to regroup. Therefore, we write down the 2 ones and carry-over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 4 and 6 (since we already carried-over the 1 ten). This gives us 10, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 0 ones in base-10. Again, since we are working in base-11, we write down the 0 ones and carry-over the 1 ten to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column, which are the carried-over 1 ten and the 0 from the previous step.

To add 67 and 49 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 9. Since 7+9=16, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit.

To solve this problem, we need to convert the digits "9A" and "40" into base-10, perform the addition, and then convert the result back into base-11.\n\nIn base-11, the digit "A" represents the value 10. Therefore, "9A" represents the value 9 times 11 plus 10, which is 109 in base-10.\n\nTo convert "40" into base-10, we can use the formula:\n\n4*11^1 + 0*11^0 = 44\n\nNow we can add 109 and 44 in base-10:\n\n109 + 44 = 153\n\nTo convert 153 back into base-11, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 153. This is 11^2, which is 121. The quotient of 153 divided by 121 is 1 with a remainder of 32. Therefore, the first digit in our base-11 representation is "1".\n\nNext, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 32. This is 11^1, which is 11.

Therefore, the second digit in our base-11 representation is "A".\n\nFinally, we have a remainder of 10, which is simply represented as "A" in base-11.

We then add this carry to the next digit from the right, which is the 100's digit. We get 1+8+5+1=15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over again. Specifically, we write down the rightmost digit of 15, which is 5, and carry over the leftmost digit, which is 1. Finally, we add this carry to the leftmost digit, which is 1. We get 1+5+1=7.

Converting 86 and 90 to base-10, we get 8*11 + 6 = 94 and 9*11 + 0 = 99. Adding these two numbers in base-10, we get 193. \n\nConverting 193 back to base-11, we have to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 193. This is 11^2 = 121. The quotient when 193 is divided by 121 is 1, so the first digit in our base-11 representation is 1. \n\nWe subtract 121 from 193 to get 72. The largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 72 is 11^1 = 11. The quotient when 72 is divided by 11 is 6, so the second digit in our base-11 representation is 6. \n\nFinally, we have a remainder of 6 when we divide 72 by 11. Therefore, the last digit in our base-11 representation is 6. \n\nPutting it all together, we have 86+90 = 1 6 6 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{166}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 82 and 7A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 2 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we carry-over 1 to the next digit. The sum of the units digits is therefore C (which represents 12 in base-10), and we write down the digit C and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the elevens place, which are 8 and 7. Adding the carry-over from the previous step, we get 10, which is represented by the digit A in base-11. We write down the digit A in the elevens place.\n\nTherefore, 82+7A = CA\\boxed{A}.

To add 76 and A9 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 6 and 9. Since 6+9=15, which is greater than 10, we need to carry-over the 1 to the next column. Thus, the sum of the rightmost digits is 5, and we write down the digit 5 as the rightmost digit of the result. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 7 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-11, we have 7+10=17. Again, this is greater than 10, so we carry-over the 1 to the next column. Thus, the sum of the second column from the right is 7, and we write down the digit 7 as the second digit from the right of the result.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digit, which is 1. Thus, the sum of 76 and A9 in base-11 is 186, and we write down \\boxed{186} as the result.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 56 and AA in base-11, we first need to convert AA to base-10. \n\nAA in base-10 is equal to 10*11^1 + 10*11^0 = 121. \n\nNow we can add 56 and 121 in base-10: \n\n  56\n+121\n----\n 177\n\nSo the result is 177 in base-10. \n\nTo convert 177 back to base-11, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 177. This is 11^2 = 121. \n\nThe coefficient of 11^2 in 177 is 1, so we write down "1" as the first digit in our base-11 representation. \n\nWe subtract 121 from 177 to get 56, which is less than the next power of 11 (11^1 = 11). \n\nThe coefficient of 11^1 in 56 is 5, so we write down "5" as the second digit in our base-11 representation. \n\nFinally, we have no 11^0 terms left, so we write down "6" as the third digit in our base-11 representation. \n\nTherefore, 56+AA = 16A in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{16A}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

But we also need to add the "A" that we carried over from the ones place. So we have 8+8+A=16+A. Since 16 is greater than 10, we carry over an "A" to the next digit, and write down "6" as the digit in the tens place of the sum. \n\nFinally, we add the carried over "A" to the leftmost digit, which is 0. We get A+0=A. \n\nTherefore, 88+89=176 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{176}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 63 and 56 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 3 and 6. Since 3+6=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Next, we move to the next digit from the right, which is the digit in the 11's place. Here, we have 6+5=11, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over to the next digit. Specifically, we carry over 1 to the next digit to the left, and write down 0 as the digit in the 11's place. Finally, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digit from the left, which is 6+1=7. Therefore, the sum of 63 and 56 in base-11 is 70. \n\n\\boxed{70}	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 67 and 37 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 7. This gives us 14, which is equal to 1 ten and 4 ones in base-11. We write down the 4 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 6 and 3, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 10, which is equal to 1 ten and 0 ones in base-11. We write down the 0 and carry the 1 over to the next column. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 0 and 1, and we add the carried-over 1. This gives us 2, which is equal to 0 tens and 2 ones in base-11. \n\nTherefore, 67+37=204 in base-11, or $\\boxed{204}$.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 57+68? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 57 and 68 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 8. Since 7+8=15, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down the digit 5 (the units digit of 15) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) plus 5 and 6. This gives us 12, which is also greater than 10, so we carry over 1 again to the next digit. We write down the digit 2 (the units digit of 12) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) plus 5 and 6. This gives us 12 again, so we carry over 1 to the next digit. We write down the digit 2 (the units digit of 12) and carry over 1 to the next digit. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the final carried-over 1. Therefore, 57+68=120 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{120}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 56 and 9A in base-11, we start by adding the units digits, which are 6 and A. Since A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry-over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying-over from A results in 100 (since 10+1=11 in base-10, which is represented as A0 in base-11). Therefore, we have:\n\n```\n  56\n +9A\n----\n 100 (carry-over)\n  10 (units digit)\n```\n\nSo, 56+9A in base-11 is equal to 10. Therefore, the result is $\\boxed{10}$.

A1+52 in base-11 is equal to BC. \n\nTo see why, we can start by adding the two numbers in base-10: \n\nA1 (base-11) = 10*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 121 + 1 = 122\n52 (base-11) = 5*11^1 + 2*11^0 = 55 + 2 = 57\n\n122 + 57 = 179\n\nNow we need to convert 179 back into base-11. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 11 and keeping track of the remainders: \n\n179 \xf7 11 = 16 remainder 3 (3)\n16 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 5 (5)\n1 \xf7 11 = 0 remainder 1 (1)\n\nSo 179 (base-10) = 153 (base-11), and \n\nA1+52 = BC \n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{BC}.

To add 92 and 31 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 2 and 1. This gives us 3, which we write down as the rightmost digit of the result. Next, we move to the next digit from the right and add the carry from the previous step (which is 1) to the digits 9 and 3. This gives us 13, which is equal to A in base-11. We write down A as the next digit of the result, and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the carry to the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1. This gives us 2, which we write down as the leftmost digit of the result. Therefore, 92+31= A2\\boxed{A2}.	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

Since 7+9=16, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. 16 in base-11 is written as 15 with a carry-over of 1, so we write down the digit 5 and carry-over the 1. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the next column, which are 1 (from the carry-over) and 8. 1+8=9, so we write down the digit 9. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the leftmost column, which are 0 and 2. 0+2=2, so we write down the digit 2. \n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  87\n+29\n---\n 116\n\nTherefore, 87+29=116 in base-11. \n\n$\\boxed{116}$	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

To add 90 and 3A in base-11, we start by lining up the digits in the ones place:\n\n```\n  90\n+ 3A\n----\n```\n\nSince A represents the value 10 in base-10, we need to carry over to the next place value when the sum of the digits in a column is greater than 10. In this case, we have:\n\n```\n  90\n+ 3A\n----\n   A\n```\n\nSo the ones place of the sum is A. Next, we move to the elevens place:\n\n```\n  90\n+ 3A\n----\n  10A\n```\n\nSince the sum of 9 and A is greater than 10, we carry over to the elevens place.

To add 77 and 35 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 7 and 5. This gives us 12, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 2 ones in base-10. However, in base-11, we cannot have a digit greater than 9, so we need to regroup the 1 ten as 11 ones. Therefore, we write down the digit 2 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column, which are 7 and 3, and add the carried-over digit of 1. This gives us 11, which is equivalent to 1 ten and 1 one in base-10. Again, we need to regroup the 1 ten as 11 ones in base-11, so we write down the digit 1 and carry-over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over digit of 1 to the leftmost column, which gives us 1.

To add 89 and 60 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 0. Since 9+0=9, we write down 9 as the rightmost digit of the sum. We then move to the next digits to the left, which are 8 and 6. 8+6=14, but since there is no digit for 14 in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. So we write down 4 as the second digit of the sum, and carry over 1 to the next digit. Finally, we add the leftmost digits, which are 0 and 1 (the carried-over digit). 0+1=1, so we write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum.

To add 99 and 38 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, which are 9 and 8. Since 9+8=18, which is greater than 10, we need to carry over to the next digit. In base-11, carrying over means adding 1 to the next digit. So we write down the digit 8 and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nNext, we add the digits in the second column from the right, which are 9 and 3 (the carried-over 1 plus the digit in the second column of 99). This gives us 12, which is also greater than 10, so we carry over again. We write down the digit 2 and carry over the 1 to the next digit. \n\nFinally, we add the digits in the third column from the right, which are 1 (the carried-over 1) and 9 (the digit in the third column of 99). This gives us 10, which is equal to 11 in base-10. Since we are working in base-11, we write down the digit A instead of 10. \n\nTherefore, 99+38=128 in base-11, which is \\boxed{128}.

Converting 30 and 93 to base-10, we get 33 and 104, respectively. Adding these two numbers in base-10 gives us 137. \n\nNow, we need to convert 137 back to base-11. We can do this by repeatedly dividing by 11 and keeping track of the remainders. \n\n137 divided by 11 is 12 with a remainder of 5, so the rightmost digit in our base-11 representation is 5. \n\n12 divided by 11 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so the next digit is 1. \n\nFinally, 1 divided by 11 is 0 with a remainder of 1, so the leftmost digit is also 1. \n\nTherefore, 30+93 = 137 in base-10 is equivalent to \\boxed{115} in base-11.
