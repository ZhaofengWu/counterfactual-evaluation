In base-11, A represents the number 10 in base-10. So, A0 in base-11 is equivalent to 10 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 110 in base-10. Similarly, AA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 121 in base-10.\n\nNow, we add the two numbers in base-10: 110 + 121 = 231.\n\nTo convert 231 back to base-11, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 231 by 11: 231 \xf7 11 = 21 with a remainder of 0. So, the least significant digit is 0.\n2. Divide the quotient (21) by 11: 21 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 10. So, the next digit is A (which represents 10 in base-11).\n3. The quotient is now 1, which is less than 11, so the most significant digit is 1.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the result 1A0 in base-11.\n\nSo, A0 + AA in base-11 is \\boxed{1A0}.

So, we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 8 + 8 + 1. In base-10, this is equivalent to 8 + 8 + 1 = 17. To convert 17 back to base-11, we have 1 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0, which is 16 in base-11.\n\nSo, the final result is 169 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{169}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Adding the leftmost digits and the carry-over: 4 + 1 (carry-over) + A (which is 10 in base-10) = 4 + 1 + 10 = 15. Since 15 in base-11 is represented as "14" (1*11^1 + 4*11^0), we write down "14" to the left of the previous result.\n\nSo, 46 + A4 in base-11 is equal to 14A.\n\nThe result is: \\boxed{14A}.

This is equal to (1 * 11^1) + (5 * 11^0) = 11 + 5 = 16 in base-10.\n\nNow, we can add the two numbers in base-10: 113 + 16 = 129.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 129 by 11 to get 11 with a remainder of 8. So, 11 * 11^1 = 121.\n2.

Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 10 in the 1's place. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the 1's place.\n\nNow, moving to the next column (the 11's place), we have 5 + 9 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous column). In base-10, this is 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 in the 11's place (15 - 11 = 4).\n\nFinally, we have 1 in the 121's place (from the carry-over).\n\nSo, the result of 50 + 9A in base-11 is 140.\n\n\\boxed{140}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, 18 in base-11 is 17 (1*11^1 + 7*11^0).\n\nNow, we add the remaining digits, including the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 + 9 = 12 in base-10\n\nSince 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. So, 12 in base-11 is 11 (1*11^1 + 1*11^0).\n\nPutting the digits together, we get:\n\n1 (carry-over) 1 7\n\nSo, 2A + 98 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{117}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 78 and 51 in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column (the 1s place), we have 8 + 1 = 9. So, we write down 9 in the rightmost column of the result.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column (the 11s place), we have 7 + 5 = 12. Since we are in base-11, we need to express 12 as 1 \xd7 11^1 + 1 \xd7 11^0, which is equivalent to 10 + 1 in base-11. So, we write down 1 in the leftmost column of the result and carry over the 1 to the next column (the 11^2 place).\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we simply write down the carried-over 1 in the 11^2 place.\n\nThus, the result of 78 + 51 in base-11 is 119.\n\n\\boxed{119}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra value. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14 (1 * 11^1 + 4 * 11^0). So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 4:\n\n```\n  1\n  86\n+70\n-----\n 46\n```\n\nThus, the result is 46 in base-11. So, the answer is \\boxed{46}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are in base-11, we need to convert 13 to base-11. 13 in base-11 is 1A (1 * 11^1 + A * 11^0 = 11 + 10 = 21). So, we write A in the leftmost position of the result and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result:\n\n  1\n  85\n+51\n-----\n 1A6\n\nSo, 85 + 51 in base-11 is 1A6.

To add the numbers 9A and 62 in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have A + 2. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, 10 + 2 = 12. Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column.

So, we write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, we add the numbers in the next column, considering the carry-over: 3 + 8 + 1 = 12. In base-11, 12 is represented as 11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 1 * 11^0 = 12). So, we write down 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the next column: 1.

To add the numbers 33 and A4 in base-11, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 3 + 4 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n2. Leftmost column: 3 + A (which is 10 in base-11) = 13 in base-10. Since 13 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column (to the left).

To add A1 and 94 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 4. Since 1+4=5, we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Next, we add the leftmost digits, which are A and 9. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10+9=19. Since 19 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over.

In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 6 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we move to the next column and add 9, 9, and the carried-over 1. This gives us 9 + 9 + 1 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we write down the carried-over 1 in the leftmost column.\n\nSo, the sum of 9A and 96 in base-11 is 196.\n\n\\boxed{196}.

In base-11, A is equal to 10, so 10+1+8=19. Since 19 is greater than 10, we write down 9 and carry over 1 to the next place. Since there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, A7+84 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{190}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, A1 in base-11 is equal to (10 \xd7 11^1) + (1 \xd7 11^0) = 110 + 1 = 111 in base-10.\n\nNow, we need to add A1 + A1, which is equivalent to adding 111 + 111 in base-10. This results in 222 in base-10.\n\nTo convert 222 back to base-11, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 222 by 11: 222 \xf7 11 = 20 with a remainder of 2.

To add A2 and 30 in base-11, we first need to convert the numbers to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equal to 10 in base-10. So, A2 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 110 + 2 = 112 in base-10.\n\nNow, we can add 112 and 30 in base-10: 112 + 30 = 142.\n\nNow, we need to convert 142 back to base-11. To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 142 by 11: 142 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 10. So, the first digit (from the right) is A (which represents 10 in base-11).\n\n2.

So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, for the next column (the 11s place):\n\n7 + 3 = 10 in base-10. Since we carried over 1 from the previous column, we add that as well: 10 + 1 = 11 in base-10, which is 10 in base-11. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns, we just write down the carried-over 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{1A}.

So, we write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, for the leftmost column:\n(4 + 6) + 1 (carry-over) = 11 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-11 (since 11 - 1 = 10).

To do this, we can perform the following divisions:\n\n201 \xf7 11 = 18 R 3 \u2192 The remainder is the least significant digit (rightmost digit).\n\n18 \xf7 11 = 1 R 7 \u2192 The remainder is the next digit to the left.\n\n1 \xf7 11 = 0 R 1 \u2192 The remainder is the next digit to the left, and we stop since the quotient is 0.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 173.

To add AA and 92 in base-11, we need to perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have A + 2. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, 10 + 2 = 12. Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have A + 9 + 1 (the carry-over). Again, A represents 10, so 10 + 9 + 1 = 20. Since 20 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 9.\n\nFinally, we have 1 (the carry-over) in the leftmost column.\n\nSo, the result of AA + 92 in base-11 is 191.

To add A1 and AA in base-11, we perform the addition just like in base-10, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 10 (A in base-11).\n\n  A1\n+AA\n-----\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits: 1 + A. Since A is 10 in base-11, 1 + A = 1 + 10 = 11. This is equal to 10 in base-11, so we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\n  1\n A1\n+AA\n-----\n  0\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: A + A + 1. Since A is 10 in base-11, A + A + 1 = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21. This is equal to 1A in base-11, so we write down 1A.\n\n  1\n A1\n+AA\n-----\n1A0\n\nSo, A1 + AA in base-11 is 1A0.\n\n\\boxed{1A0}.

To add the numbers 82 and A9 in base-11, we start by adding the digits in the least significant place (rightmost digits) and work our way to the left.\n\n1. Add the least significant digits: 2 + 9 = 11. Since we are in base-11, 11 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Add the next digits along with the carry-over: 8 + A (which is 10 in base-10) + 1 (carry-over) = 8 + 10 + 1 = 19. In base-11, 19 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + A * 11^0).

In base-11, the number 14 is equivalent to 1*11^1 + 4*11^0 = 11 + 4 = 15 in base-10. The number 66 is equivalent to 6*11^1 + 6*11^0 = 66 + 6 = 72 in base-10. Adding these two numbers together in base-10 gives us 15 + 72 = 87.\n\nNow, we need to convert 87 back to base-11. To do this, we divide 87 by 11 and find the remainder:\n\n87 \xf7 11 = 7 with a remainder of 10.\n\nSo, 87 in base-11 is 7A (7*11^1 + 10*11^0).\n\nTherefore, 14 + 66 in base-11 is \\boxed{7A}.

To add 1A and 17 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, A and 7. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 7 = 17 in base-10. Since 17 is greater than 11, we subtract 11 and carry over 1 to the next digit. So, 17 - 11 = 6 in base-10, which is 6 in base-11.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the next digits, 1 and 1. So, 1 + 1 = 2 in base-11.\n\nThus, 1A + 17 in base-11 is equal to 26 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{26}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 25 and 5A in base-11, we need to perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 5 + A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, 5 + 10 = 15. Since 15 is greater than the highest digit in base-11 (which is A or 10), we need to carry over the extra value to the next column. 15 in base-11 is represented as 14 (1*11^1 + 4*11^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we move to the next column and add the carried-over 1 to the digits 2 and 5. So, 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.\n\nPutting the results together, we get the final answer: 84.\n\nSo, 25 + 5A in base-11 is \\boxed{84}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 60 and 8A in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column (the 1's place), we have 0 + A. Since A in base-11 represents the value 10 in base-10, the sum is 10. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the current column.\n\nNow, moving to the next column (the 11's place), we have 6 + 8 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous column). In base-10, this sum is 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column and write down 5 in the current column.\n\nFinally, we have 1 in the next column (the carry-over from the previous column).\n\nSo, the sum of 60 and 8A in base-11 is 150.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{150}.

In base-10, this would be 11, but since we are in base-11, we represent 11 as 10, or "A". So, 7 + 4 = A.\n\nPutting the results together, we have A3.\n\nSo, 70 + 43 in base-11 is \\boxed{A3}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 85+A2? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 85 and A2 in base-11, we start by adding the digits in the least significant place (rightmost digits) and work our way to the left.\n\n1. Add the least significant digits: 5 + 2 = 7.\n2. Add the next digits, considering the carry if any: 8 + A (which is 10 in base-11) = 18 in base-10. Since we are working in base-11, we need to convert 18 to base-11, which is 16 (1 * 11^1) + 7 (7 * 11^0). So, we have a carry of 1 and a digit of 6.\n\nNow, we put the digits together, starting with the carry, then the digits we found: 1, 6, and 7. So, the sum of 85 and A2 in base-11 is 167.\n\n\\boxed{167}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A0 and 72 in base-11, we first need to convert the numbers to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equal to 10 in base-10. So, A0 in base-11 is equal to 10 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 110 in base-10.\n\nNow, we convert 72 in base-11 to base-10. This is equal to 7 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 77 + 2 = 79 in base-10.\n\nNow, we add the base-10 numbers: 110 + 79 = 189.\n\nFinally, we convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we divide 189 by 11 and find the remainder:\n\n189 \xf7 11 = 17 with a remainder of 2.\n\nNow, we divide the quotient (17) by 11:\n\n17 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 6.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 162.\n\nTherefore, A0 + 72 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{162}.

To add the numbers 29 and A2 in base-11, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 9 + 2 = 11. Since we're in base-11, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n2. Leftmost column: 1 (carry-over) + 2 + A. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 1 + 2 + 10 = 13. We write down 3 and carry over 1 to an additional column.\n3. Additional column: We only have the carry-over 1, so we write down 1.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the result 130 in base-11.

Since A represents 10 in base-11, we have:\n\n6 + A = 6 + 10 = 16\n\nSince 16 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value.

To add A1 and 54 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 4. Since 1+4=5, we write down 5 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Next, we add the leftmost digits, which are A and 5. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have 10+5=15. Since 15 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over the extra value. 15 in base-11 is represented as 14 (since 1*11^1 + 4*11^0 = 15).

To add A9 and 83 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 9 and 3. Since 9+3=12, which is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next place and write down 2. Now, we add A, 8, and the carried-over 1. In base-11, A represents 10, so 10+8+1=19. Since 19 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next place and write down 9.

To add the numbers 61 and 3A in base-11, we'll perform the addition column by column, just like we do in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column (the 1s place), we have 1 + A. Since A in base-11 represents the value 10 in base-10, we have 1 + 10 = 11. In base-11, 11 is represented as 10, so we write down a 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column (the 11s place), we have 6 + 3 + 1 (the carry-over).

In base-11, the number 13 is represented as 12 (1*11^1 + 3*11^0) and the number 89 is represented as 81 (8*11^1 + 9*11^0). Now, we can add these two numbers:\n\n12 + 81 = (1*11^1 + 3*11^0) + (8*11^1 + 9*11^0)\n\nNow, we can add the coefficients of the same powers of 11:\n\n(1+8)*11^1 + (3+9)*11^0 = 9*11^1 + 12*11^0\n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 12 in the 11^0 place:\n\n9*11^1 + 1*11^1 + 1*11^0 = 10*11^1 + 1*11^0\n\nIn base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A".

To add A8 and 79 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 8 and 9. Since 8+9=11 in base-10, we carry over 1 and write down 0 in the rightmost position. Now, we add A, 7, and the carried-over 1. In base-10, A is equal to 10, so 10+7+1=18. Since 18 in base-11 is 16, we write down 1 and carry over 1. Finally, we add the carried-over 1 to get 2.

To add the numbers 88 and 38 in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column:\n8 + 8 = 16 (in base-10), which is 15 in base-11 (since 16 - 1 = 15). So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next column:\n1 (carry-over) + 8 + 3 = 12 (in base-10), which is 11 in base-11 (since 12 - 1 = 11). So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we have 1 (carry-over) in the leftmost column.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the result: 115 in base-11.\n\nSo, 88 + 38 in base-11 is \\boxed{115}.

To add the numbers 3A and 49 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, A and 9. Since A in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have:\n\nA + 9 = 10 + 9 = 19\n\nSince 19 is greater than the base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit and write down the remainder, which is 8 (19 - 11 = 8).\n\nNow, we add the remaining digits, 3 and 4, along with the carry-over 1:\n\n3 + 4 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88 in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 7A+1A? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 7A and 1A in base-11, we can perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 addition.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have A + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 10 = 20 in base-10. To convert this back to base-11, we have 20 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 9. So, we write down the digit 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we move to the next column and add 7, 1, and the carried-over 1. In base-10, this is 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. Since 9 is already a valid digit in base-11, we don't need to convert it.\n\nPutting the digits together, we have the result 9 and 9, which in base-11 is written as 99.\n\nSo, 7A + 1A in base-11 is \\boxed{99}.

In base-11, we write 13 as 12:\n\n  1\n  62\n+69\n-----\n120\n\nSo, 62 + 69 in base-11 is \\boxed{120}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 57 and 6A in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 7 and A. Since A represents 10 in base-11, we have 7 + 10 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 7 (17 in base-11 is 17 - 11 = 6 with a carryover of 1).\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 5 and 6, along with the carryover of 1. This gives us 5 + 6 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 (12 in base-11 is 12 - 11 = 1 with a carryover of 1).\n\nFinally, we write down the carryover of 1 in the leftmost column.

In base-11, 18 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we carry over the 1 to the next column and write down the A.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1 (carried over) + 0 (no other digits in this column) = 1\n\nPutting the digits together, we get:\n\n1A7\n\nSo, 96 + 91 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A7}.

In base-10, this would be 10, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the current column.\n\nSo, the result is 1 in the next column (since there are no more digits to add), and the final result is 10A in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{10A}.

To add the numbers 37 and 6A in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column (the 1's place), we have 7 + A. Since A represents 10 in base-11, 7 + A = 7 + 10 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16 (1 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0).

To add the numbers 83 and 5A in base-11, we'll add the digits in each place, remembering that A represents 10 in base-11.\n\nStarting with the rightmost digit, we have 3 + A. Since A is 10, this is equivalent to 3 + 10 = 13 in base-10. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1(11^1) + 2(11^0), so we write down the 2 and carry the 1 to the next place.\n\nNow, we add the digits in the next place: 8 + 5 + 1 (the carry from the previous step). In base-10, this is 8 + 5 + 1 = 14. In base-11, 14 is represented as 1(11^1) + 3(11^0), so we write down the 3 and carry the 1 to the next place.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry, giving us a final result of 132 in base-11.\n\nSo, 83 + 5A in base-11 is \\boxed{132}.

In base-11, 15 is represented as 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we just write down the 1 that was carried over.\n\nSo, A8 + 42 in base-11 is 14A.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{14A}.

So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, moving to the next column (the 11s place):\n\n5 + 7 = 12 in base-10. Since we carried over 1 from the previous column, we add that as well: 12 + 1 = 13 in base-10. To convert 13 to base-11, we divide by 11 and get 1 remainder 2.

To add A7 and 52 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 7 and 2. Since 7+2=9, we don't need to carry over any value. Next, we add the leftmost digits, A and 5. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so 10+5=15. However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 15 as 11+4, which is 14 in base-11. So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 4.\n\nThus, A7+52 in base-11 is equal to 1(11)+4(1)=11+4=15 in base-10, which is represented as \\boxed{14} in base-11.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, A0 in base-11 is equal to 10 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 110 in base-10.\n\nNow, we convert 96 in base-11 to base-10. This is equal to 9 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0 = 99 + 6 = 105 in base-10.\n\nNow, we add the two base-10 numbers: 110 + 105 = 215.\n\nFinally, we convert the result back to base-11: \n\n215 \xf7 11^2 = 215 \xf7 121 \u2248 1 (remainder 94)\n94 \xf7 11^1 = 94 \xf7 11 = 8 (remainder 6)\n6 \xf7 11^0 = 6 \xf7 1 = 6\n\nSo, the result is 186 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{186}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 2A+73? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 2A and 73 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, A and 3. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have 10 + 3 = 13. Since 13 is greater than the base, we subtract 11 and carry over 1 to the next column. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 2 (13 - 11).\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 2 and 7, along with the carry-over 1. We have 2 + 7 + 1 = 10. In base-11, 10 is represented by the digit A.\n\nSo, the sum of 2A and 73 in base-11 is A2.\n\n\\boxed{A2}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A8 and 95 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 8 and 5. Since 8+5=13, which is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next place and write down 3. Now, we add A (which is 10 in base-10) and 9, along with the carry-over 1. So, 10+9+1=20. Since 20 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next place and write down 0. Finally, we write down the carry-over 1 in the leftmost place.\n\nSo, A8+95 in base-11 is equal to 1033 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{1033}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we add the carry-over 1 to the next digits: 7+4+1=12 in base-10, which is equal to 13 in base-11 (since 12 in base-10 is 1*11^1 + 3*11^0).\n\nSo, the final result is 134 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{134}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write 8 in the rightmost position of the result.\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits: 8 + 6 = 14. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to express 14 in base-11. 14 in base-11 is 13, which is written as "1A". So, we write "A" in the leftmost position of the result and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result:\n\n  1\n  1A\n+ 0\n-----\n  1A\n\nSo, the final result is 84 + 64 = \\boxed{1A8} in base-11.

So, we have:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 6 (base-11) + 1 (base-11) = 8 (base-11)\n\nNow, we combine the results:\n\n8 (base-11) and 5 (base-11)\n\nSo, 6A + 15 in base-11 is equal to 85 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{85}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  92\n+46\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 2 + 6 = 8 (no carrying needed). Now, moving to the next digit, we have 9 + 4 = 13 in base-10. Since we are working in base-11, we need to convert 13 to base-11, which is 11 + 2 = 1A. So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\n```\n  1\n  92\n+46\n-----\n  D8\n```\n\nSo, 92 + 46 in base-11 is \\boxed{D8}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 19 is represented as 18 (1*11^1 + 8*11^0). So, we carry over 1 and keep 8 in the current digit.\n\nNow, considering the carried over digit:\n1 (no other digits to add)\n\nSo, the final result is 187 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{187}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add these numbers, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column (the 11^0 column).\n\nIn the 11^0 column, we have 7 + 8 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 5. So far, we have:\n\n```\n  1\n  17\n+78\n-----\n  5\n```\n\nIn the 11^1 column, we have 1 + 7 + 1 (the carry-over) = 9. Since 9 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over any value to the next column. We write down 9 in the 11^1 column:\n\n```\n  1\n  17\n+78\n-----\n 95\n```\n\nSo, 17 + 78 in base-11 is 95. The result is \\boxed{95}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 68+88? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-11, the digits are "0123456789A". Let's perform the addition:\n\n```\n  68\n+88\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 8+8=16. In base-11, 16 is represented as "15" (1*11^1 + 5*11^0). So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  68\n+88\n-----\n  5\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 6+8+1 (the carry-over) = 15. In base-11, 15 is represented as "14" (1*11^1 + 4*11^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n1\n  68\n+88\n-----\n 45\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, the final result is 145 in base-11.\n\nSo, 68+88 in base-11 is \\boxed{145}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 88+89? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-11, the digits are 0123456789A, where A represents 10 in base-10. Let's perform the addition:\n\n```\n  88\n+ 89\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, 8 + 9 = 17 in base-10. Since 17 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16, so we write down 6 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  88\n+ 89\n-----\n   6\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 8 and 8, along with the carry-over 1: 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 in base-10. Again, 17 is greater than 10, so we need to carry over 1. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16, so we write down 1 and 6:\n\n```\n 1\n  88\n+ 89\n-----\n 166\n```\n\nSo, 88 + 89 in base-11 is 166.

To add A7 and 37 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 7 and 7. In base-11, 7+7 is 13, which we write as 10 and carry over 1. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we add the next digits, A and 3, along with the carry-over 1. In base-11, A is equal to 10 in base-10. So, we have 10+3+1 = 14 in base-10. Since 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over 1 to the leftmost position.\n\nSo, A7+37 in base-11 is equal to 130 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{130}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 57+68? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-11, we perform the addition similarly to how we do in base-10, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n7 + 8 = 15 (base-10), which is 14 in base-11 (since 15 - 11 = 4). So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next digit:\n(5 + 6) + 1 (carry-over) = 12 (base-10), which is 11 in base-11 (since 12 - 11 = 1). So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carry-over 1.\n\nThus, 57 + 68 in base-11 is equal to 114 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{114}.

To add the numbers 56 and 9A in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column (the 1's place), we have 6 + A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, 6 + 10 = 16. Since 16 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. 16 in base-11 is written as 15 (1*11^1 + 5*11^0). So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we move to the next column (the 11's place) and add the carried-over 1 to the original digits: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. Since 15 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over again. 15 in base-11 is written as 14 (1*11^1 + 4*11^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, we write down the carried-over 1 in the next column (the 121's place).\n\nSo, the sum of 56 and 9A in base-11 is 145. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{145}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A1+52? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A1 and 52 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, which are 1 and 2. Since 1+2=3, we write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Next, we add the leftmost digits, which are A and 5. In base-11, A represents the value 10, so we have 10+5=15. Since 15 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over the extra value. 15 in base-11 is represented as 13 (1*11^1 + 3*11^0). So, we write down 3 as the leftmost digit of the sum and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost digits of the sum, which gives us 1+3=4. So, the final sum is 43 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, A1+52 in base-11 is \\boxed{43}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 2. So, the final result is:\n\n```\n  1\n  92\n+31\n-----\n 123\n```\n\nThus, the sum of 92 and 31 in base-11 is \\boxed{123}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\n```\n  1\n  87\n+29\n-----\n  6\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 8 and 2, along with the carry-over 1. In base-11, 8 + 2 + 1 = 11, which is represented as "10" in base-11. So, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\n```\n 1\n  87\n+29\n-----\n 06\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1.\n\n```\n  87\n+29\n-----\n106\n```\n\nSo, 87 + 29 in base-11 is 106.

In base-10, this is equal to 11. Since 11 is equal to 10 in base-11, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over 1 to the leftmost column, which is empty. So, we just write down 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result 60 + 4A = \\boxed{100} in base-11.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 5A+32? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 5A and 32 in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column:\nA (which is 10 in base-10) + 2 = 12 in base-10. Since 12 is greater than the base-11 maximum digit (A), we subtract 11 from 12 and carry over 1 to the next column. So, we have 1 in the rightmost column and carry over 1.\n\nNow, in the next column:\n5 + 3 + 1 (carry over) = 9 in base-10.

So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result:\n1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo, the final result is 1A5 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, 92 + 83 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A5}.

We have 8 + 3 = 11. However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remaining 0.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n```\n  87\n+32\n-----\n 109\n```\n\nThus, the sum of 87 and 32 in base-11 is \\boxed{109}.

To do this, we divide 41 by 11:\n\n41 \xf7 11 = 3 with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, in base-11, 41 is represented as 38. Therefore, the result is:\n\n\\boxed{38}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 57 and 19 in base-11, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column (the 1's place), we have 7 + 9. In base-11, 7 + 9 = 16, which is represented as "16" in base-11.

To add the numbers 6A and 81 in base-11, we first add the rightmost digits, A and 1. Since A in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have:\n\nA + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\n\nSince 11 is equal to the base, we carry over 1 to the next digit and write down 0 as the rightmost digit of the sum. Now, we add the remaining digits, 6 and 8, along with the carry-over 1:\n\n6 + 8 + 1 = 15\n\nSince 15 is greater than the base-11, we need to convert it to base-11. To do this, we divide 15 by 11:\n\n15 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 4\n\nSo, we write down 4 as the next digit and carry over 1 to the next place. Since there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1 as the leftmost digit of the sum. Thus, the sum of 6A and 81 in base-11 is:\n\n6A + 81 = 140\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{140}.

So, we have:\n8 + 10 = 18\n\nSince 18 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over the extra value to the next column. To do this, we'll subtract the base from the sum and carry over the remaining value:\n18 - 11 = 7\n\nSo, we carry over 1 to the next column (the 121's place) and write down 7 in the current column.\n\nNow, we have:\n1 (carried over) + 0 = 1\n\nPutting the results together, we get the final sum:\n1 7 5\n\nSo, 80 + A5 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{175}.

To add the numbers 53 and 6A in base-11, we'll perform the addition column by column, just like we do in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 3 + A. Since A represents 10 in base-11, we have 3 + 10 = 13. Since 13 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 2 (13 - 11) and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have 5 + 6 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 12. Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 1 (12 - 11) and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we have the carry-over 1 in the leftmost column.\n\nSo, the sum of 53 and 6A in base-11 is 112.\n\nThus, the result is \\boxed{112}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A7+55? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A7 and 55 in base-11, we start by adding the rightmost digits, 7 and 5:\n\n7 + 5 = 12 in base-10, which is equal to 11 + 1 in base-11.

So, we write 8 in the ones place of the result.\n\nNext, we add the digits in the tens place: 6 + 7 = 13. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to express 13 in base-11. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we write A in the tens place of the result and carry over the 1 to the next place.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the result, giving us 1 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 65 + 73 in base-11 is 1A8.

To add the numbers 56 and A0 in base-11, we'll add the digits in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost digit (ones place): 6 + 0 = 6\n2. Leftmost digit (elevens place): 5 + A (which is 10 in base-11) = 15 in base-10. Since we are working in base-11, we need to convert 15 back to base-11. 15 divided by 11 is 1 with a remainder of 4.
