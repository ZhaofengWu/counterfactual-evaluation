To add the numbers 9E and 13 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have E + 3. In base-16, E represents 14, so 14 + 3 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 17 in base-16 is represented as 11, so we write down 1 and carry over the other 1.\n\nNow, we move to the next column and add 9, 1 (from the carry-over), and 1.

To add the numbers 7D and 1C in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column (the units place), we have D + C. Since D is 13 in base-10 and C is 12 in base-10, their sum is 25 in base-10. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0, which is 19. So, we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we move to the leftmost column (the 16s place) and add 7, 1, and the carried-over 1. In base-10, this is 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. So, we write down the 9.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the base-16 sum 99.\n\nSo, 7D + 1C in base-16 is \\boxed{99}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, so we have 13 + 1 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, we write E in the rightmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  E D\n+ D 1\n-----\n    E\n```\n\nNext, we add E, D, and the carried-over 1.

So, we write C in the next column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  E D\n+ D 1\n-----\n  1 C E\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, the final result is 1CE.

In base-16, 481 can be represented as 1 * 16^2 + 14 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0, which is 1E1. So, F0 + F1 = \\boxed{1E1}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, A represents 10 and E represents 14. So, A + E = 10 + 14 = 24. Since 24 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 24 in base-16 is 18, so we write down 8 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  8A\n+ 5E\n-----\n   8\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits 8, 5, and the carried-over 1.

To add the numbers 1D and 42 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  1D\n+ 42\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: D + 2. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 2 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F.

Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 1 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down a 1 and carry over a 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  E4\n+ 1C\n-----\n 100\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, the final result is 100 in base-16.\n\nSo, E4 + 1C = \\boxed{100}.

To add the two numbers 8A and EA in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  8A\n+ EA\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits A and A. In base-16, A represents the decimal number 10. So, 10 + 10 = 20 in decimal. Since 20 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 20 in base-16 is written as 14, so we write down the 4 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  8A\n+ EA\n-----\n  14\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits 8, E, and the carried-over 1.

In base-16, 30 is represented as 1E (1 * 16^1 + 14 * 16^0). So, we write E in the result and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  2F\n+ 2F\n-----\n  E\n```\n\nNext, we add 2, 2, and the carried-over 1. This gives us 2 + 2 + 1 = 5:\n\n```\n 1\n  2F\n+ 2F\n-----\n 5E\n```\n\nSo, 2F + 2F in base-16 is \\boxed{5E}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we carry over the 1 and write down the B.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum is 1B9.\n\nSo, C4 + F5 = \\boxed{1B9}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, C represents 12 in decimal, so we have 12 + 2 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, we write E as the rightmost digit of the sum and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n   1\n  BC\n+ D2\n-----\n   E\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, B and D, along with the carry-over 1. In base-16, B represents 11 and D represents 13, so we have 11 + 13 + 1 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented by the digits 1 and 9 (since 25 = 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0). So, we write 19 as the leftmost digits of the sum:\n\n```\n   1\n  BC\n+ D2\n-----\n 19E\n```\n\nThus, BC + D2 in base-16 is equal to 19E. The result is \\boxed{19E}.

To add the numbers 1C and 13 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  1C\n+ 13\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: C + 3. In base-16, C represents 12 and 3 represents 3. So, 12 + 3 = 15, which is F in base-16. Therefore, we write F in the rightmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  1C\n+ 13\n-----\n  F\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 1 + 1. In base-16, 1 represents 1. So, 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, we write 2 in the leftmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  1C\n+ 13\n-----\n  2F\n```\n\nSo, 1C + 13 in base-16 is equal to 2F. The final answer is \\boxed{2F}.

In base-16, 17 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0 = 11. So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\n2. 9 + 1 (carried over) + 1: This is equivalent to 9 + 1 + 1 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented as B. So, we write down B.\n\nPutting the results together, we get the sum 97 + 1A = B1 in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{B1}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 14 and E8 in base-16, we first need to convert the letters to their corresponding numerical values. In base-16, E represents 14 and F represents 15. So, the addition becomes:\n\n```\n  14\n+E8\n```\n\nNow, we add the numbers column by column, starting from the right:\n\n```\n  1  4\n+  E  8\n```\n\nIn the right column, we have 4 + 8, which is 12 in base-10.

To add A4 and EC in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 4 + C\nSince C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 4 + 12 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. Leftmost column: A + E + 1 (carry-over)\nA is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and E is equivalent to 14 in base-10. So, we have 10 + 14 + 1 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 19. So, we write down 19.\n\nPutting the results together, we have 190 as the sum of A4 and EC in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{190}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A9 and CF in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  A9\n+ CF\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add 9 and F. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 9 + 15 = 24 in base-10. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0), so we write down 8 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  A9\n+ CF\n-----\n  18\n```\n\nNext, we add A, C, and the carried-over 1. In base-10, A is 10 and C is 12, so we have 10 + 12 + 1 = 23 in base-10. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17 (1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0):\n\n```\n   1\n  A9\n+ CF\n-----\n 178\n```\n\nSo, A9 + CF in base-16 is 178. The result is \\boxed{178}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 50 and DE in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15 (since base-16 has 16 digits).\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 0 + E. Since E is 14 in base-10, the sum is 14. We don't need to carry over since 14 is less than 16. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is E.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have 5 + D. Since D is 13 in base-10, the sum is 5 + 13 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. To do this, we subtract 16 from 18, which gives us 2, and carry over the 1. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nPutting the digits together, we have the base-16 sum 50 + DE = 3E.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{3E}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write 19 as 13 in base-16, which is represented by the digit "3", and carry over the 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n1\n 65\n+D4\n-----\n 139\n\nSo, 65 + D4 in base-16 is \\boxed{139}.

Add the leftmost digits: F + A = 15 + 10 = 25 (which is 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0 in base-16)\n3. Combine the results: 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0 + 3 * 16^0 = 1 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0\n\nSo, F1 + A2 = \\boxed{1C3} in base-16.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add B2 and CD in base-16, we perform the addition similarly to base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15 (F in base-16).\n\nStarting with the rightmost digits, we have 2 + D. Since D is 13 in base-10, the sum is 2 + 13 = 15, which is F in base-16. There is no carry-over in this case.\n\nNow, we move to the next digits, B and C. B is 11 in base-10, and C is 12 in base-10. The sum is 11 + 12 = 23. Since this exceeds 15, we have a carry-over. The remainder after subtracting 16 from 23 is 7, so the second digit in the sum is 7.\n\nThe carry-over is 1, so the final sum is 17F in base-16.\n\nTherefore, B2 + CD in base-16 is \\boxed{17F}.

To add F6 and 5D in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 6 + D. Since D is 13 in base-10, we have 6 + 13 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15, we carry over 1 and write down 3 (19 - 16) in the rightmost column.\n\nNow, we move to the leftmost column and add F, 5, and the carried-over 1. Since F is 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 5 + 1 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 15, we carry over 1 and write down 5 (21 - 16) in the leftmost column.\n\nSo, the sum of F6 and 5D in base-16 is 153.

In base-16, EF is represented as (14 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0) and EC is represented as (14 * 16^1) + (12 * 16^0). Adding these two numbers, we get:\n\n(14 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0) + (14 * 16^1) + (12 * 16^0) = (14 * 16^1) + (14 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0) + (12 * 16^0)\n\n= 2 * (14 * 16^1) + (15 + 12) * 16^0\n\n= 2 * (14 * 16^1) + 27 * 16^0\n\nNow, we need to convert 27 back to base-16. Since 27 = 1 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0, we can represent it as 1B in base-16.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n2 * (14 * 16^1) + 1 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0\n\n= (2 * 14 + 1) * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0\n\n= 29 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0\n\nIn base-16, 29 is represented as 1D, so the final result is:\n\n1D * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0\n\nWhich is 1D1B in base-16.\n\nSo, EF + EC = \\boxed{1D1B}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 2F+68? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 2F and 68 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  2F\n+68\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: F + 8. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 8 is 8, their sum is 23 in base-10. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17, so we write down the 7 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  2F\n+68\n-----\n  7\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 2 + 6 + the carried-over 1. In base-10, this is 2 + 6 + 1 = 9. In base-16, 9 is still 9, so we write down the 9:\n\n```\n 1\n  2F\n+68\n-----\n 97\n```\n\nSo, 2F + 68 in base-16 is 97. The final answer is \\boxed{97}.

To add the numbers 30 and 4B in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 0 + B. Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, we have 0 + 11 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B, so we write down B and carry over 0.\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have 3 + 4 = 7. Since there is no carry-over from the previous column, our final result is 7B.\n\nSo, 30 + 4B in base-16 is \\boxed{7B}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 6F and 59 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  6F\n+ 59\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: F + 9. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 9 is 9, their sum is 15 + 9 = 24. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0). So, we write down the 8 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  6F\n+ 59\n-----\n   8\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 6 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 6 + 5 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C. So, we write down the C:\n\n```\n   1\n  6F\n+ 59\n-----\n  C8\n```\n\nThus, the sum of 6F and 59 in base-16 is \\boxed{C8}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, A represents 10, so 10 + 2 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, we write down C and carry over 0 (since there is no carry over in this case).\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have F + 3. In base-16, F represents 15, so 15 + 3 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented by the digits 1 and 2, so we write down 12.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n```\n  FA\n+ 32\n-----\n 12C\n```\n\nSo, FA + 32 in base-16 is \\boxed{12C}.

In base-16, 12 is represented by the letter C. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, 6 and 4, and the carry-over 1. This gives us 6 + 4 + 1 = 11 in base-10. In base-16, 11 is represented by the letter B.\n\nPutting the two digits together, we get the base-16 sum: BC.\n\nSo, 67 + 45 in base-16 is \\boxed{BC}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, B represents 11 and 7 represents 7. So, 11 + 7 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is represented as 12, so we write down the 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  5B\n+ 27\n-----\n   2\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.

In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10. So, 4 + 14 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is written as 12, so we write down the 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  9 4\n+ D E\n-----\n    2\n```\n\nNow, we add 9, D, and the carried-over 1. In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 in base-10. So, 9 + 13 + 1 = 23. Since 23 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 23 in base-16 is written as 17, so we write down the 7 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  9 4\n+ D E\n-----\n  1 7 2\n```\n\nSo, 94 + DE in base-16 is equal to 172.

In base-16, C is 12 and D is 13. So, 12 + 13 = 25. Since 25 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 25 in base-16 is 19, so we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we move to the leftmost column and add F, 3, and the carried-over 1. In base-16, F is 15. So, 15 + 3 + 1 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15, we need to represent it using two digits. 19 in base-16 is 13, so we write down 13.\n\nPutting the two columns together, we get the result 139.

To add the numbers 6F and CD in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  6F\n+ CD\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add F and D. Since F is 15 and D is 13 in base-10, their sum is 28. In base-16, 28 is represented as 1C (1 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0). So, we write down C and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  6F\n+ CD\n-----\n   C\n```\n\nNext, we add 6, C, and the carried-over 1. In base-10, 6 is 6, C is 12, and 1 is 1, so their sum is 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13 (1 * 16^1 + 3 * 16^0). So, we write down 13:\n\n```\n   1\n  6F\n+ CD\n-----\n  13C\n```\n\nThus, the sum of 6F and CD in base-16 is 13C.\n\n\\boxed{13C}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since B is 11 and C is 12 in base-10, their sum is 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17 (1*16^1 + 7*16^0). So, we write down the 7 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  1B\n+ 8C\n-----\n   7\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits 1 and 8, and also add the carry-over 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  1B\n+ 8C\n-----\n  17\n```\n\n1 + 8 + 1 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-16.

In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down the 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  3E\n+ F4\n-----\n   2\n```\n\nNext, we add the digits in the left column, along with the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 3 + F\n\nIn base-16, F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, so we have:\n\n1 + 3 + 15 = 19\n\nSince 19 is greater than 15, we need to represent it using two digits in base-16. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down the 13:\n\n```\n 1\n  3E\n+ F4\n-----\n 132\n```\n\nSo, 3E + F4 in base-16 is equal to 132.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{132}.

Since 16 is the base, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\n2. Add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: F + 8 + 1 = 15 + 8 + 1 = 24. Since 24 is greater than 16, we subtract 16 to get 8 and carry over a 1.\n\n3. Since we have a carry-over, we write down a 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, F5 + 8B = 180.\n\nThus, the result is \\boxed{180}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 77 and D6 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 7 + 6 = D (since 7 + 6 = 13 in base-10, and 13 is represented by D in base-16).\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have 7 + D. In base-10, this is 7 + 13 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14 (since 16 * 1 + 4 = 20), so we have 1 in the next column and 4 in the current column.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the leftmost column, 4 in the middle column, and D in the rightmost column. So, 77 + D6 in base-16 is \\boxed{14D}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 86 and A1 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  8  6\n+ A  1\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: 6 + 1 = 7. So, we write 7 in the rightmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  8  6\n+ A  1\n-----\n    7\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 8 + A. Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, we have 8 + 10 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12 (1 * 16^1 + 2 * 16^0). So, we write 12 in the leftmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  8  6\n+ A  1\n-----\n  1  2  7\n```\n\nTherefore, 86 + A1 in base-16 is 127. The result is \\boxed{127}.

To add the two numbers BF and F3 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  BF\n+ F3\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add F and 3. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 3 is 3, their sum is 18.

So, we simply write down the carry-over 1 in the next column to the left.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sum:\n1 (carry-over) | 1 (leftmost column) | 4 (rightmost column)\n\nSo, 45 + BF in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{114}.

In base-16, C represents 12 and 6 represents 6. So, 12 + 6 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  AC\n+ C6\n-----\n   2\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, A and C, along with the carry-over 1.

To add the numbers 7B and AA in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have B + A. In base-16, A represents 10 and B represents 11. So, B + A = 11 + 10 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is represented as 15 (which is F) + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have 7 + A + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, 7 represents 7 and A represents 10. So, 7 + A + 1 = 7 + 10 + 1 = 18.

Since C represents 12 in base-10, we have 8 + 12 = 20 in base-10. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14 (1 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  1 8\n+ 4 C\n-----\n    4\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6. We write down the 6:\n\n```\n  1\n  1 8\n+ 4 C\n-----\n  6 4\n```\n\nSo, 18 + 4C in base-16 is equal to 64 in base-16.\n\n\\boxed{64}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Therefore, the rightmost digit of the sum is F:\n\n```\n  C1\n+ AE\n-----\n   F\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, C and A. In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 and A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 12 + 10 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented by the digits 1 and 6 (since 22 = 1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0). Therefore, the leftmost digits of the sum are 1 and 6:\n\n```\n  C1\n+ AE\n-----\n 16F\n```\n\nSo, C1 + AE in base-16 is 16F. The result is \\boxed{16F}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 1 + 12 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, we write D in the rightmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n   1\n  C1\n+ EC\n-----\n   D\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: C + E + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, C and E are equivalent to 12 and 14, respectively. So, we have 12 + 14 + 1 = 27. In base-16, 27 is represented by the digits 1B (since 1 * 16^1 + B * 16^0 = 16 + 11 = 27). So, we write 1B in the leftmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  1B\n  C1\n+ EC\n-----\n 1BD\n```\n\nThus, the sum of C1 and EC in base-16 is 1BD. The final answer is \\boxed{1BD}.

So, we write down D and carry over 0.\n\nNow, the leftmost column:\n2 + E + 0 (carry over) = 2 + 14 = 16 in base-10, which is 10 in base-16. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there is a carry over, we need to add another digit to the left:\n1 (carry over) = 1 in base-16.\n\nSo, the sum of 25 and E8 in base-16 is 1D.

To add the numbers FD and 4F in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  FD\n+ 4F\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: D + F. Since D is 13 and F is 15 in base-10, their sum is 28. In base-16, 28 is represented as 1C (1 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0). So, we write down C and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  FD\n+ 4F\n-----\n   C\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: F + 4 + 1 (the carry-over). Since F is 15 in base-10, their sum is 15 + 4 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14 (1 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0).

To add the numbers 4F and 72 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  4F\n+72\n```\n\nFirst, we add F and 2. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 2 is 2, their sum is 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11 (1*16^1 + 1*16^0). So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n 1\n  4F\n+72\n-----\n  11\n```\n\nNext, we add 4, 7, and the carried-over 1. In base-10, this is 4 + 7 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C. So, we write down the C:\n\n```\n 1\n  4F\n+72\n-----\n  C11\n```\n\nSo, 4F + 72 in base-16 is C11.\n\n\\boxed{C11}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add E4 and 82 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  E4\n+ 82\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits, 4 and 2:\n\n```\n4 + 2 = 6\n```\n\nSo, we write 6 as the rightmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  E4\n+ 82\n-----\n  6\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, E and 8. In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, so:\n\n```\n14 (E) + 8 = 22\n```\n\nSince 22 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is equivalent to 16 + 6, or 1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0. So, we write 6 as the leftmost digit of the result and carry over 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  E4\n+ 82\n-----\n  66\n```\n\nSo, E4 + 82 in base-16 is equal to 166. The final answer is \\boxed{166}.

To add the numbers EA and E3 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  E A\n+ E 3\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add A and 3. In base-16, A represents 10 and 3 represents 3, so A + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, we write D in the rightmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n   1\n  E A\n+ E 3\n-----\n    D\n```\n\nNext, we add E, E, and the carried-over 1.

To add the numbers CF and BB in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  C  F\n+ B  B\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits F and B:\n\nF in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, and B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10. So, we have:\n\n15 + 11 = 26 in base-10.\n\nSince 26 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over to the next column. To find the base-16 equivalent of 26, we divide 26 by 16:\n\n26 \xf7 16 = 1 remainder 10.\n\nSo, the rightmost digit of the sum is A (which is equivalent to 10 in base-10), and we carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  C  F\n+ B  B\n-----\n    A\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits C, B, and the carry-over 1:\n\nC in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10, and B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10.

To find the base-16 equivalent of 24, we divide 24 by 16:\n\n24 \xf7 16 = 1 remainder 8.\n\nSo, the leftmost digit of the sum is 18 (which is equivalent to 24 in base-10):\n\n```\n  1\n  C  F\n+ B  B\n-----\n  1  8  A\n```\n\nTherefore, CF + BB in base-16 is equal to 18A.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{18A}.

In base-16, B represents the decimal number 11. So, 11 + 11 = 22 in decimal. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, which is written as 16. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  1B\n+ CB\n-----\n   6\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits 1 and C, along with the carry-over 1.

So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 5.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  B4\n+ A2\n-----\n  156\n\nSo, B4 + A2 = \\boxed{156}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 42+ED? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 42 and ED in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 2 + D. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 2 + 13 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have 4 + E. Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 4 + 14 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, which is equivalent to the digit 2 and a carry-over of 1. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is 2, and we have a carry-over of 1.\n\nAdding the carry-over to the next column, we get 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, the final sum is 12F.\n\nTherefore, 42 + ED in base-16 is \\boxed{12F}.

To add AD and 96 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column:\nD + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 19 in base-16 is 13, so we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, for the next column, we add A, 9, and the carried-over 1:\nA + 9 + 1 = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20. Since 20 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 20 in base-16 is 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carried-over 1.\n\nSo, AD + 96 in base-16 is 143.

In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16) + 6. So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 6.\n\nThus, B0 + B4 = 164.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{164}.

To add the two numbers 9F and 5C in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Add the rightmost column: F + C = 1B (since F is 15 and C is 12, their sum is 27, which is 1B in base-16)\n2. Carry over the 1 to the next column.\n3. Add the leftmost column: 9 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over) = F (since 9 + 5 + 1 = 15, which is F in base-16)\n\nSo, 9F + 5C = FB in base-16.\n\n\\boxed{FB}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  92\n+ 2F\n-----\n```\n\nWe start by adding the rightmost digits: 2 + F. Since F represents 15 in base-16, we have 2 + 15 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11 (1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0). So we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  92\n+ 2F\n-----\n  11\n```\n\nNow we add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 9 + 2 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C. So we write down the C:\n\n```\n  1\n  92\n+ 2F\n-----\n  C11\n```\n\nSo, 92 + 2F in base-16 is C11.\n\n\\boxed{C11}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add AB and 52 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  AB\n+ 52\n-----\n```\n\nFor the rightmost digit, we have B + 2. Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, we have 11 + 2 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, we write D as the rightmost digit of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n   1\n  AB\n+ 52\n-----\n   D\n```\n\nFor the next column, we have A + 5 + 1. Since A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 5 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented by the two-digit number 10. So, we write 0 as the next digit of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n   1\n  AB\n+ 52\n-----\n  0D\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write the carried-over 1 as the leftmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  AB\n+ 52\n-----\n 10D\n```\n\nSo, AB + 52 in base-16 is 10D.

Now, we move to the next digits, C and D. In base-16, C represents 12 and D represents 13. Adding these two numbers gives us 25. However, since we are in base-16, we need to convert this number back to base-16 representation. \n\n25 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0, which is written as 19. So, we write down 9 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  C0\n+ D7\n-----\n  197\n```\n\nSo, C0 + D7 in base-16 is 197. The result is \\boxed{197}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A0 and AB in base-16, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  A0\n+ AB\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits, 0 and B. Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, the sum is 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B, so we write B as the rightmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  A0\n+ AB\n-----\n  1B\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, A and A. Since A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, the sum is 10 + 10 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented by the digits 14, so we write 1 as the leftmost digit of the result and carry over the 4:\n\n```\n  14\n  A0\n+ AB\n-----\n  1B\n```\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 4 to the leftmost digits of the result, 1:\n\n```\n  14\n  A0\n+ AB\n-----\n  1B\n+  4\n-----\n```\n\nThe sum is 1 + 4 = 5, so we write 5 as the leftmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  14\n  A0\n+ AB\n-----\n  1B\n+  4\n-----\n  5B\n```\n\nSo, A0 + AB in base-16 is 5B.

To add the numbers 7C and CA in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  7C\n+ CA\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: C + A. In base-16, C represents 12 and A represents 10. So, C + A = 12 + 10 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, which is represented as 16.\n\nSo, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  7C\n+ CA\n-----\n   6\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 + 7 + C. In base-16, 7 represents 7 and C represents 12. So, 1 + 7 + C = 1 + 7 + 12 = 20. Since 20 is greater than 15, we need to represent it using two digits. 20 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0, which is represented as 14.\n\nSo, we write down the 14:\n\n```\n   1\n  7C\n+ CA\n-----\n 146\n```\n\nTherefore, 7C + CA in base-16 is 146.

To add the two numbers 2F and 7A in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 arithmetic.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have F + A. Since F is 15 and A is 10 in base-10, their sum is 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0, which is 19.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 94+DF? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add 94 and DF in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  9 4\n+ D F\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add 4 and F.

In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in decimal, so 14 + 1 = 15, which is F in base-16. So, we write F in the rightmost column and carry over 0:\n\n```\n  5E\n+ F1\n-----\n   F\n```\n\nNext, we add 5 and F. In base-16, F is equivalent to 15 in decimal, so 5 + 15 = 20.

So, we write down B and carry over 0.\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, A and E, along with any carry-over. In base-10, A is 10 and E is 14. So, 10 + 14 = 24 in base-10. Since 24 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 24 - 16 = 8 in base-10, which is 8 in base-16. So, we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over 1 to the result, giving us 18B in base-16.\n\nSo, A3 + E8 = \\boxed{18B} in base-16.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, B is equivalent to 11 in base-10, so we have 11 + 9 = 20. Since 20 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 20 in base-16 is equal to 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  B4\n+ 92\n-----\n 46\n```\n\nNow, we add the carried-over 1 to the result:\n\n```\n 1\n  B4\n+ 92\n-----\n146\n```\n\nSo, B4 + 92 in base-16 is 146.

Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is equal to 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next column:\nA + 7 + 1 (carry over) = 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. As before, 18 is greater than 15, so we need to carry over again. 18 in base-16 is equal to 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, AE + 75 in base-16 is equal to 1, 2, and 2, which is written as 122.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{122}.

To calculate B3 + A3 in base-16, we perform the addition just like in base-10, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15 (F in base-16).\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n3 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, moving to the next digit:\nB (11 in base-10) + A (10 in base-10) = 21 in base-10\n\nSince 21 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is 15 + 6, which is F6. So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 6.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n  B3\n+ A3\n-----\n  1F6\n\nSo, B3 + A3 in base-16 is \\boxed{1F6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add E5 and CF in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  E5\n+ CF\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits, 5 and F. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 5 + 15 = 20 in base-10. Converting 20 back to base-16, we get 14, which is represented as 1(16^1) + 4(16^0) = 14. So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  E5\n+ CF\n-----\n   4\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, E and C, along with the carry-over 1. In base-10, E is equivalent to 14 and C is equivalent to 12. So, we have 14 + 12 + 1 = 27 in base-10. Converting 27 back to base-16, we get 1(16^1) + B(16^0) = 1B. So, we write down the 1B:\n\n```\n   1\n  E5\n+ CF\n-----\n 1B4\n```\n\nThus, the sum of E5 and CF in base-16 is 1B4.\n\n\\boxed{1B4}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 53 and BD in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15.\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have 3 + D. Since D is 13 in base-10, we have 3 + 13 = 16. Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost column, we have 5 + B + 1 (the carry-over). Since B is 11 in base-10, we have 5 + 11 + 1 = 17. Since 17 is equal to 11 in base-16, we write down a 1 and carry over a 1.\n\nPutting the results together, we have 110 in base-16.\n\nSo, 53 + BD in base-16 is \\boxed{110}.

To add the numbers 58 and D3 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10 addition.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column:\n\n8 + 3 = B (since 8 + 3 = 11 in base-10, and 11 is represented by B in base-16)\n\nNow, moving to the next column:\n\n5 + D = 12 (since 5 + 13 = 18 in base-10, and 18 - 16 = 2 with a carry-over of 1)\n\nSo, we have a carry-over of 1 to add to the next column. Since there are no more digits in either number, we simply write the carry-over as the leftmost digit.\n\nThus, 58 + D3 = \\boxed{12B} in base-16.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is D.\n\n2. Add the next digits: B + 9. Since B is 11 in base-10 and 9 is 9, we have 11 + 9 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented by the number 14 (16 + 4). So, we write down the digit 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n3. Add the carried-over 1 to the next column.

Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, we have 1 + 10 = 11.

In base-16, C represents 12 and A represents 10. So, 12 + 10 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, which is written as 16. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  3C\n+ EA\n-----\n   6\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, 3 and E, along with the carry-over 1. In base-16, E represents 14.

To add the numbers 6C and 57 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  6C\n+57\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: C + 7. In base-16, C represents 12 and 7 represents 7. So, 12 + 7 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 19 in base-16 is represented as 13. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  6C\n+57\n-----\n  3\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 6 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, 6 represents 6 and 5 represents 5. So, 6 + 5 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C:\n\n```\n 1\n  6C\n+57\n-----\n C3\n```\n\nSo, 6C + 57 in base-16 is C3.\n\n\\boxed{C3}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers 48 and 4B in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10.\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have 8 + B. Since B is 11 in base-10, we have 8 + 11 = 19 in base-10. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have 4 + 4 + the carry-over 1, which is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 in base-10. Since 9 is the same in both base-10 and base-16, we write down 9.\n\nSo, the sum of 48 and 4B in base-16 is 93. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{93}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Rightmost column: 7 + A\n   Since A represents 10, we have 7 + 10 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0 = 11. So, we write down 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\n2. Leftmost column: 8 + A + 1 (carry-over)\n   Since A represents 10, we have 8 + 10 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 3 * 16^0 = 13. So, we write down 13.\n\nPutting the results together, we get the base-16 number 131.\n\nSo, 87 + AA in base-16 is \\boxed{131}.

To add D9 and 38 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  D9\n+ 38\n-----\n```\n\nFor the rightmost column, we have 9 + 8 = 11 in base-10, which is B in base-16. So, we write B in the rightmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n 1\n  D9\n+ 38\n-----\n   B\n```\n\nFor the next column, we have D + 3 + 1 (the carry-over) = 13 + 3 + 1 = 17 in base-10, which is 11 in base-16. So, we write 1 in the next column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n 1\n  D9\n+ 38\n-----\n  1B\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we can stop here.

To add the two numbers 6F and B4 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  6F\n+ B4\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add F and 4. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 4 is 4, their sum is 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  6F\n+ B4\n-----\n   3\n```\n\nNext, we add 6, B (which is 11 in base-10), and the carry-over 1. The sum is 6 + 11 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  6F\n+ B4\n-----\n  23\n```\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we include the carry-over 1 in the final result:\n\n```\n  6F\n+ B4\n-----\n 123\n```\n\nSo, 6F + B4 in base-16 is \\boxed{123}.

In base-16, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  D7\n+ 14\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits: 7 + 4 = 11. Since 11 in base-10 is B in base-16, we write B and carry over 1.\n\n```\n  1\n  D7\n+ 14\n-----\n   B\n```\n\nNext, we add the remaining digits along with the carry-over: 1 + D + 1 = 1 + 13 + 1 = 15. Since 15 in base-10 is F in base-16, we write F.\n\n```\n  1\n  D7\n+ 14\n-----\n  FB\n```\n\nSo, D7 + 14 in base-16 is FB. The result is \\boxed{FB}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Add the leftmost column: E + C = 14 + 12 = 26. Since 26 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 26 in base-16 is equal to 1A, so we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we combine the results and get 1A6.\n\nSo, E6 + C0 in base-16 is \\boxed{1A6}.

To add the numbers 91 and 9A in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  91\n+ 9A\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: 1 + A. Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, we have 1 + 10 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B. So, we write B in the rightmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  91\n+ 9A\n-----\n   B\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 9 + 9 + 1 (the carry-over). In decimal, this is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented by the digit 13, which is written as "13". So, we write 1 in the leftmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist, so we just write it down):\n\n```\n 1\n  91\n+ 9A\n-----\n 1B\n```\n\nThus, the result of 91 + 9A in base-16 is 1B.

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F.\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have:\n\n4 + 8\n\nSince these are both base-16 digits, we can add them directly:\n\n4 + 8 = 12\n\n12 in base-16 is represented by the digit C.

To add BE and 48 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10, but carrying over when the sum is 16 or greater.\n\n```\n  BE\n+48\n-----\n```\n\nStarting with the rightmost column, we have E + 8. In base-16, E is 14 and 8 is 8, so 14 + 8 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n```\n 1\n  BE\n+48\n-----\n  6\n```\n\nNow, we move to the leftmost column. We have B + 4 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, B is 11, so 11 + 4 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down 10.\n\n```\n 1\n  BE\n+48\n-----\n 106\n```\n\nSo, BE + 48 in base-16 is 106. The result is \\boxed{106}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since B is 11 in base-10, we have 6 + 11 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0 = 11. So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  B6\n+ 2B\n-----\n   1\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + B + 2.

Since 26 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 26 in base-16 is equal to 1A, so we write down A and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  9C\n+ 2E\n-----\n   A\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 + 9 + 2. In base-16, 1 + 9 = A and A + 2 = C. So, we write down C:\n\n```\n   1\n  9C\n+ 2E\n-----\n  CA\n```\n\nTherefore, 9C + 2E in base-16 is equal to CA. The result is \\boxed{CA}.

In base-16, B represents 11 and 3 represents 3. So, 11 + 3 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. Therefore, we write E as the rightmost digit of the sum and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n   1\n  BB\n+ B3\n-----\n   E\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits B and B, as well as the carry-over 1.

E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10. So, we have 14 + 14 = 28 in base-10. Converting 28 back to base-16, we get 1C (since 1 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0 = 28).

To add A9 and B7 in base-16, we perform the addition just like in base-10, but carrying over when the sum is 16 or greater.\n\nStarting with the rightmost digits, we have 9 + 7 = 10. Since 10 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 0, and we carry over 1.\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, A and B, along with the carry-over 1. In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 and B is equivalent to 11. So, we have 10 + 11 + 1 = 22.

To add the two numbers C5 and F0 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  C5\n+ F0\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column (5 + 0). Since 5 + 0 = 5, we write down 5 in the rightmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  C5\n+ F0\n-----\n   5\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column (C + F). In base-16, C represents 12 and F represents 15. So, 12 + 15 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. To do this, we subtract 16 from 27, which gives us 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B.

Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 2 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, we write F in the rightmost column of the result and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n   1\n  1D\n+ 92\n-----\n  F\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost column: 1 + 9 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 1 + 9 + 1 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B. So, we write B in the leftmost column of the result:\n\n```\n   1\n  1D\n+ 92\n-----\n  BF\n```\n\nThus, the sum of 1D and 92 in base-16 is BF. The final answer is \\boxed{BF}.

Now, moving to the next digits, we have D + C. In base-16, D represents 13 and C represents 12. So, 13 + 12 = 25. Since 25 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 25 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0, which is written as 19.\n\nSo, the final result is 198. Therefore, D8 + C0 = \\boxed{198}.

To add the numbers 9B and 9F in base-16, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  9B\n+ 9F\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add B and F. Since B is 11 and F is 15 in base-10, their sum is 26.

To add 9E and 9F in base-16, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  9E\n+ 9F\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add E and F. In base-16, E is 14 and F is 15. So, 14 + 15 = 29. Since 29 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 29 in base-16 is 1D, so we write down D and carry over 1.\n\n```\n 1\n  9E\n+ 9F\n-----\n  1D\n```\n\nNow, we add the leftmost digits, 9 and 9, along with the carry-over 1.

In base-16, A represents 10 and 7 represents 7. So, 10 + 7 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. 17 in base-16 is represented as 11, so we write down 1 and carry over 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  8A\n+C7\n-----\n  11\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits 8 and C, along with the carry-over 1.

Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 1 + 14 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F.

To add the numbers 1A and 23 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n```\n  1A\n+ 23\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost column: A + 3. In base-16, A represents the decimal number 10. So, 10 + 3 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 87+28? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-16, we perform the addition as follows:\n\n```\n  87\n+28\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 7 + 8 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the letter F.

So, we write F and carry over 0.\n\nNow, moving to the next digit:\nF + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16, which is 10 in base-16. So, we write 1 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write the carried over 1 in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, F3 + 1C = 1FF in base-16.\n\n\\boxed{1FF}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 84+C4? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 84 and C4 in base-16, we perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n```\n  8  4\n+ C  4\n-----\n```\n\nFirst, we add the rightmost digits, 4 and 4, which gives us 8:\n\n```\n  8  4\n+ C  4\n-----\n    8\n```\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits, 8 and C. Since C represents 12 in base-10, we have 8 + 12 = 20 in base-10. To convert 20 to base-16, we divide 20 by 16, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 4. So, 20 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-16:\n\n```\n  8  4\n+ C  4\n-----\n  1  4  8\n```\n\nTherefore, 84 + C4 in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{148}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
