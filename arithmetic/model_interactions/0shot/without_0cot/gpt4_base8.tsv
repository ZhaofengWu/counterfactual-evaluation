You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 20+64? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-8, the number 20 represents 2*8^1 = 16 in base-10, and the number 64 represents 6*8^1 + 4*8^0 = 48 + 4 = 52 in base-10. Adding these two numbers together in base-10, we get 16 + 52 = 68. \n\nNow, we need to convert 68 back to base-8. Since 8^2 = 64 is too large, we know the result will have two digits. The largest multiple of 8 less than 68 is 8*10 = 64, so the first digit is 1. Subtracting 64 from 68, we get 4, which is the second digit. \n\nSo, 20+64 in base-8 is equal to \\boxed{104}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 60+60? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-8, the number 60 represents 6*8^1 + 0*8^0 = 48 in base-10. So, 60+60 in base-8 is equivalent to 48+48 in base-10, which is 96. Now, we need to convert 96 back to base-8.\n\n96 divided by 8 is 12 with a remainder of 0, so the least significant digit is 0. Then, 12 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 4, so the next digit is 4. Therefore, 96 in base-10 is 140 in base-8.\n\nSo, 60+60 in base-8 is \\boxed{140}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 55+26? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers 55 and 26 in base-8, we can follow the same process as in base-10, but carrying over when the sum of digits is 8 or greater.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n5 + 6 = 11 (base-8), so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next digit:\n1 (carry-over) + 5 + 2 = 10 (base-8), so we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, 55 + 26 in base-8 is \\boxed{101}.

To add the numbers 31 and 72 in base-8, we perform the addition column by column, just like in base-10:\n\n```\n  31\n+72\n-----\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have 1 + 2 = 3. So, we write down 3 in the rightmost column of the result:\n\n```\n  31\n+72\n-----\n  3\n```\n\nNow, moving to the next column, we have 3 + 7. In base-8, 3 + 7 = 12, which is 1 eight and 2 units. So, we write down 2 in the current column and carry over 1 to the next column:\n\n```\n 1\n  31\n+72\n-----\n 23\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, the final result is 123 in base-8. So, the answer is \\boxed{123}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 17+64? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	In base-8, the number 17 is equal to 1\xd78^1 + 7\xd78^0 = 8 + 7 = 15 in base-10. The number 64 is equal to 6\xd78^1 + 4\xd78^0 = 48 + 4 = 52 in base-10. Adding these two numbers together in base-10, we get 15 + 52 = 67.\n\nNow, we need to convert 67 back to base-8. To do this, we find the highest power of 8 that is less than or equal to 67, which is 8^2 = 64. Since 64 is greater than 67, we move to the next lower power of 8, which is 8^1 = 8. We can fit 8 into 67 eight times (8\xd78 = 64), so the coefficient for the 8^1 term is 8. Subtracting 64 from 67, we get a remainder of 3, which is the coefficient for the 8^0 term.\n\nSo, the base-8 representation of 67 is 83. Therefore, 17+64 in base-8 is \\boxed{83}.

We write down the 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n 1\n  65\n+ 36\n-----\n  23\n```\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we are done.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 36+63? End the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To calculate 36+63 in base-8, we perform the addition similarly to base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum reaches 8.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n6+3 = 11 (base-8), so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, moving to the next digit:\n3+6 = 11 (base-8), but we also have the carry-over 1, so 11+1 = 12 (base-8). We write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits, we write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, 36+63 in base-8 is 121.\n\n\\boxed{121}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
