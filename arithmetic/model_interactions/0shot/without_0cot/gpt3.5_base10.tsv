To add 94 and 93, we start by adding the ones digits, which gives us 4+3=7. Then we add the tens digits, which gives us 9+9=18. Since 18 is a two-digit number, we carry the 1 over to the hundreds digit. Finally, we add the hundreds digits, which gives us 1+0+1=2. Therefore, 94+93=187, or \\boxed{187}.
