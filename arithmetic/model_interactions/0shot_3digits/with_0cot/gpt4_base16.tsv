You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is ECD+18F? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nD + F = 13 + 15 = 28 (in base-10). Since 28 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 28 in base-16 is 1C, so we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's add the next digits, including the carry-over:\n\nC + 8 + 1 (carry-over) = 12 + 8 + 1 = 21 (in base-10). Again, 21 is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is 15, so we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over:\n\nE + 1 + 1 (carry-over) = 14 + 1 + 1 = 16 (in base-10). Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down 10.\n\nSo, ECD + 18F in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{105C}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost column:\n\n7 + 6 + 1 (the carry-over) = 14 in base-10, which is E in base-16. So, we write down E.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the result:\n\n79F + 664 = \\boxed{E0D}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n2 + F:\n2 in base-10 is 2, and F in base-10 is 15. So, 2 + 15 = 17 in base-10. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11 (1*16^1 + 1*16^0). So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n3 + A + 1 (carry-over):\n3 in base-10 is 3, A in base-10 is 10, and we have a carry-over of 1. So, 3 + 10 + 1 = 14 in base-10. In base-16, 14 is represented as E. So, we write down the E and there is no carry-over this time.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n5 + F:\n5 in base-10 is 5, and F in base-10 is 15. So, 5 + 15 = 20 in base-10.

Since B is 11 in base-10 and 6 is 6, their sum is 11 + 6 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 11. So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 9 + 7 + 1. Since 9 is 9 in base-10, 7 is 7, and the carry-over is 1, their sum is 9 + 7 + 1 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 11. So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column along with the carry-over: 3 + A + 1. Since 3 is 3 in base-10, A is 10, and the carry-over is 1, their sum is 3 + 10 + 1 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented as E.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: E11.

So, we write down F and carry over 0.\n\nColumn 2 (sixteens place): 9 + 8 = 17, which is 11 in base-16. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 3 (256s place): 1 (carry-over) + 9 + E = 1 + 9 + 14 = 24, which is 18 in base-16. So, we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 4 (4096s place): 1 (carry-over) = 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 181F. Therefore, 9FE + E81 = \\boxed{181F}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the two numbers AFA and 4A2 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have A + 2. In base-16, A represents 10, so 10 + 2 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, we write down C and carry over nothing.\n\n2. Moving to the middle column, we have F + A. In base-16, F represents 15, so 15 + 10 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented by 1(16) + 9, so we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have 1 (carried over) + A + 4. In base-16, A represents 10, so 1 + 10 + 4 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, we write down F.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result: \\boxed{F9C}.

Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 7 + 14 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1(16^1) + 5(16^0), which is 15. So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 4 + 1. This gives us 7 + 4 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C. So, we write down the C.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place): 4 + D. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 4 + 13 = 17.

The middle digit of the sum is 6, and we don't need to carry over any value.\n\n3. Adding the leftmost digits: F + E\n   Since F in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, and E is equivalent to 14, we have 15 + 14 = 29.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n3 + 2 = 5 (no carrying needed)\n\nNow, let's move to the middle column.\n\nD + 8 = 13 + 8 = 21.

To add the two numbers 1E1 and A3C in base-16, we'll start by adding the digits in the same positions, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 1 + C\n   Since C in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10, the sum is 1 + 12 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, the rightmost digit of the result is D.\n\n2. Add the middle digits: E + 3\n   Since E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, the sum is 14 + 3 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11, which means we have a carry-over of 1 to the next position. So, the middle digit of the result is 1.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 + A + 1\n   Since A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, the sum is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, the leftmost digit of the result is C.\n\nPutting all the digits together, the result of the addition is C1D.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{C1D}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Adding the rightmost column: 3 + 5 = 8.\n2. Adding the middle column: 8 + E. Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 8 + 14 = 22 in base-10. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16) + 6, so the result is 16. We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n3. Adding the leftmost column: 6 + A + 1 (carry-over). Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 6 + 10 + 1 = 17 in base-10. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1(16) + 1, which is 11.\n\nPutting the results together, we have 11_16_8.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column:\n\nA + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18\n\nSince 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over:\n\nC + 1 + 1 = 12 + 1 + 1 = 14\n\nSince 14 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over any value.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column:\n\n0 + C = 0 + 12 = 12\n\nSo, the result is:\n\nC2A + C18 = 1422\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1422}.

First, let's break down the numbers into their place values:\n\n37F = 3 * 16^2 + 7 * 16^1 + 15 * 16^0\n69B = 6 * 16^2 + 9 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0\n\nNow, let's add the numbers:\n\n(3 * 16^2 + 7 * 16^1 + 15 * 16^0) + (6 * 16^2 + 9 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0)\n\nCombine the like terms:\n\n(3 * 16^2 + 6 * 16^2) + (7 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0 + 11 * 16^0)\n\nNow, perform the addition:\n\n9 * 16^2 + 16 * 16^1 + 26 * 16^0\n\nSince we are in base-16, we need to carry over when a digit is greater than or equal to 16. In this case, we have 16 * 16^1, which is equal to 1 * 16^2 + 0 * 16^1. We also have 26 * 16^0, which is equal to 1 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0. So, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\n(9 * 16^2 + 1 * 16^2) + (1 * 16^1 + 0 * 16^1) + (1 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0)\n\nNow, perform the addition again:\n\n10 * 16^2 + 2 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0\n\nFinally, let's convert this back into base-16 notation:\n\nA * 16^2 + 2 * 16^1 + A * 16^0\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n\\boxed{A2A}.

Since 9 + 2 = 11, we write down the digit "B" (which represents 11 in base-16) and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 4 + 7 + 1. Since 4 + 7 + 1 = 12, we write down the digit "C" (which represents 12 in base-16) and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column along with the carry-over: A + D + 1. Since A represents 10 and D represents 13, we have 10 + 13 + 1 = 24. To represent 24 in base-16, we write down the digit "8" and carry over 1. Since there are no more columns to add, we simply write down the carry-over digit "1" in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, A49 + 7D2 = 1CB8 in base-16.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1CB8}.

Divide 1249 by 16:\n   1249 \xf7 16 = 78 with a remainder of 1. The remainder corresponds to the least significant digit, which is 1.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (78) by 16:\n   78 \xf7 16 = 4 with a remainder of 14. The remainder corresponds to the next least significant digit, which is E (since E represents 14 in base-16).\n\n3. The quotient (4) is less than 16, so it becomes the most significant digit, which is 4.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the base-16 number 4E1.\n\nSo, 16A + 377 in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{4E1}.

B is 11 in base-10, C is 12, and 1 is 1, so their sum is 24 in base-10. Since 24 is 16 + 8, we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\n4.

Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 4 + 1 + 10 = 15 in base-10. In base-16, 15 is represented as F, so we write down F.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 9 + 0 = 9.\n\nPutting all the results together, we have 9F4. So, 948 + A4C = \\boxed{9F4}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nB + 1 = (11 in base 10) + 1 = 12 in base 10, which is C in base 16. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, E and 9, and the carry-over 1:\n\nE + 9 + 1 = (14 in base 10) + (9 in base 10) + 1 = 24 in base 10, which is 18 in base 16.

Since we are in base-16, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over:\n\n9 + F + 1 (carry-over) = 9 + 15 + 1 = 25. In base-16, this is written as 9 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, the result is 392.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: D + 2. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 2 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F, and we don't need to carry over any value.\n\nNext, let's add the middle digits: F + F. In base-10, F is equivalent to 15, so we have 15 + 15 = 30. To represent 30 in base-16, we need to find how many times 16 goes into 30 and what the remainder is. 16 goes into 30 once, with a remainder of 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, the middle digit of the sum is E, and we need to carry over the value of 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over value: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 1FD + 3F2 = 5EF.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{5EF}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nE + B = 14 + 11 = 25 (in base 10). Since 25 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 25 in base-16 is 19, so we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carried over) + 4 + 1 = 6 (in base 10). No need to carry over this time.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\nB + 7 = 11 + 7 = 18 (in base 10). Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow we have:\n\n1 (carried over) = 1 (in base 10).\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n1 6 9\n\nSo, B4B + 71E = \\boxed{169} in base-16.

So, we write down a 9 in the ones place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the 16s place): B + F. In base-16, B represents 11 and F represents 15. So, 11 + 15 = 26. Since 26 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. In base-16, 26 is represented as 1A (1 * 16^1 + 10 * 16^0). So, we write down an A in the 16s place of the result and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: C + 7 + 1. In base-16, C represents 12. So, 12 + 7 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14 (1 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0).

First, let's add the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. 8 + 2 = A (in base-16, A represents 10 in base-10)\n2. A + B = 15 (in base-16, B represents 11 in base-10, so A + B = 10 + 11 = 15, which is F in base-16)\n3. 8 + 2 = A (similar to the first step)\n\nNow, let's put the results together: A, F, and A. So, the sum of 8A8 and 2B2 in base-16 is:\n\n\\boxed{AFA}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the two numbers 2B0 and 6B5 in base-16, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 0 + 5 = 5\n2. Middle column: B + B = 11 + 11 = 22 in base-10. Since 22 in base-10 is 16 + 6, we have 16\u2081\u2086 + 6\u2081\u2086, which is 1(16) + 6. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n3.

In the rightmost column, we have 3 + 9. Since 3 + 9 = 12 in base-10, and 12 is represented as "C" in base-16, we have a "C" in the rightmost column of the result. There is no carry-over.\n\n2. In the middle column, we have 6 + 0. Since 6 + 0 = 6 in base-10, we have a "6" in the middle column of the result. There is no carry-over.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have 1 + C. Since 1 + 12 (C in base-10) = 13 in base-10, and 13 is represented as "D" in base-16, we have a "D" in the leftmost column of the result.\n\nSo, 163 + C09 in base-16 is equal to D6C in base-16.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{D6C}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): F + 4. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 4 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down a 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place): 3 + 8 + the carried-over 1. This gives us 3 + 8 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C, so we write down a C.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place): 8 + 6. This gives us 8 + 6 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented as E, so we write down an E.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result: \\boxed{EC3}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, we have 11 + 9 = 20. In base-16, 20 is written as 14, so we write down a 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 6 + F. Since F in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 1 + 6 + 15 = 22.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n5A5\n+A23\n-----\nStep 1: Add the rightmost column (5 + 3). Since 5 + 3 = 8, we can write 8 in the rightmost column of the result.\n\n5A5\n+A23\n-----\n   8\n\nStep 2: Add the middle column (A + 2). In base-16, A represents the decimal number 10.

Since 5 + 0 = 5, we can write 5 in the leftmost column of the result.\n\n5A5\n+A23\n-----\n5C8\n\nSo, 5A5 + A23 in base-16 is \\boxed{5C8}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nA (10 in decimal) + 7 = 11 in decimal, which is B in base-16. So, we write down B and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the second column.\n\n7 + 7 = 14 in decimal, which is E in base-16. But we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we add 1 to E. E (14 in decimal) + 1 = 15 in decimal, which is F in base-16. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\nD (13 in decimal) + 9 = 22 in decimal, which is 16 in base-16. But we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we add 1 to 16. 16 + 1 = 17 in base-16, which is written as 11 in base-16 (1*16^1 + 1*16^0).\n\nSo, the final result is 11FB.

To add the two numbers D59 and 6D1 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 9 + 1. This is equal to A in base-16 (since A represents 10 in base-10). So, we write down A and carry over nothing.\n\n2. Moving to the middle column, we have 5 + D. In base-10, this is equivalent to 5 + 13, which equals 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have D + 6 + the carried over 1. In base-10, this is equivalent to 13 + 6 + 1, which equals 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n4. Since we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, our final result is 142A.\n\nTherefore, D59 + 6D1 in base-16 is \\boxed{142A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-16, 13 is represented by the letter "D". So, we write down "D" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the second column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 9 + 1 = 13. Again, 13 is represented by the letter "D". So, we write down "D" to the left of the previous "D".\n\nThus, the sum of 3D9 and 9D4 in base-16 is \\boxed{DD3}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is AD9+BB2? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: 9 + 2 = 11. Since we are in base-16, 11 corresponds to the letter B. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is B.\n\nNow let's move to the next digit. We have D + B. In base-16, D corresponds to 13 and B corresponds to 11. So, 13 + 11 = 24. Since 24 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 24 in base-16 is equal to 1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0, which is 18. So, we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: A + B + 1. In base-16, A corresponds to 10 and B corresponds to 11. So, 10 + 11 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is equal to 1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0, which is 16 + 6 = 22. So, we write down 16 and 6.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum AD9 + BB2 = 168B. So, the result is \\boxed{168B}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nE + C = 14 + 12 = 26 (in base-10). Since 26 in base-16 is 1A, we write down A and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n4 + B + 1 (carried over) = 4 + 11 + 1 = 16 (in base-10). Since 16 in base-16 is 10, we write down 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carried over) = 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 4EB and B1C in base-16 is \\boxed{10A}.

Since 9 + 5 = 14 in base-10, which is E in base-16, we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: B + 2 + 1. In base-10, B is 11, so we have 11 + 2 + 1 = 14, which is E in base-16.

In base-10, C is equivalent to 12, so we have 12 + 5 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, which is C. So, we write down C and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256's place): B + E + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, B is 11 and E is 14, so we have 11 + 14 + 1 = 26. In base-16, 26 is represented as 1A.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 1ACD.

In base-10, this is 4 + 3 + 1 = 8. In base-16, 8 is still represented as 8, so we write down the 8.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: A + 2. Since A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 2 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C, so we write down the C.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we have the result: C81.

To represent 17 in base-16, we divide 17 by 16, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 1. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nColumn 3 (256s place): 1 (carry-over)\nThere are no more digits in the numbers, so we just write down the carry-over, which is 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 11F.\n\nSo, 7E4 + 99B in base-16 is \\boxed{11F}.

There is no need to carry over any value this time.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 3 + D. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 3 + 13 = 16.

So, we write down 9 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 6 + 4 + 1. In base-10, this is 11. In base-16, 11 is represented as B. So, we write down B.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: F + 7. Since F is 15 in base-10, their sum is 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 (1*16^1 + 6*16^0). So, we write down 1 and carry over 1 to the next column.

Since D is 13 and E is 14 in base-10, their sum is 27. In base-16, 27 is represented as 1B (1 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0). So, we write down B and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits along with the carry-over: 2 + 3 + 1 (carry-over). In base-10, this is 6. In base-16, 6 is represented as 6. So, we write down 6.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: C + F. Since C is 12 and F is 15 in base-10, their sum is 27. In base-16, 27 is represented as 1B (1 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0). So, we write down B and carry over the 1.\n\n4. Write down the carry-over from the previous step: 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the sum of C2D and F3E in base-16 is \\boxed{1B6B}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  C41\n+ 5AC\n_____\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 1 + C = 1 + 12 = 13 (in base-10), which is D in base-16.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): F + 9. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 9 is 9, we have 15 + 9 = 24. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0), so we write down 8 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place): 1 (carried over) + 1 + B. Since B is 11 in base-10, we have 1 + 1 + 11 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented as D, so we write down D.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place): 2 + nothing. This is just 2.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 2D8.\n\nSo, 11F + 2B9 = \\boxed{2D8}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add B4E and 4B5 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have E + 5. In base-16, E is 14 and 5 is 5, so 14 + 5 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 19 in base-16 is 13, so we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Moving to the middle column (16s place), we have 4 + B + the carry-over 1. In base-16, 4 is 4 and B is 11, so 4 + 11 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Finally, in the leftmost column (256s place), we have B + 4 + the carry-over 1. In base-16, B is 11 and 4 is 4, so 11 + 4 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we write down 10.\n\nPutting it all together, we have B4E + 4B5 = 1003 in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1003}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is CCA+5FC? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: A + C. In base-16, A is 10 and C is 12. So, 10 + 12 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: C + F + 1. In base-16, F is 15. So, 12 + 15 + 1 = 28. Again, this is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 28 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + C (12), so we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: C + 5 + 1. So, 12 + 5 + 1 = 18. This is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 2, so we write down 12 and carry over 1.\n\nSince we have a carry-over, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final result is 1 * 16^2 + 2 * 16^1 + C * 16^0 = 1 * 256 + 2 * 16 + 12 = 256 + 32 + 12 = 300.\n\nThus, CCA + 5FC in base-16 is \\boxed{12C6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  199\n+ 9F1\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 9 + 1 = A (since 9 + 1 = 10 in base-10, and 10 is represented as A in base-16)\n\n2. 9 + F = 18 (since 9 + 15 = 24 in base-10, and 24 - 16 = 8 with a carry-over of 1)\n\n3. 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 9 = B (since 1 + 1 + 9 = 11 in base-10, and 11 is represented as B in base-16)\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n  BA8\n\nTherefore, 199 + 9F1 in base-16 is \\boxed{BA8}.

Units column: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Sixteens column: 8 + C. Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 8 + 12 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14, so we write down 4 and carry over the 1.\n3. Two hundred fifty-sixes column: D + 8 + 1 (carry-over). Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 8 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16.\n\nSo, the sum of D81 and 8C3 in base-16 is 1644.\n\n\\boxed{1644}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nF (15 in base-10) + 8 = 23 in base-10, which is 17 in base-16. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (from the carry over) + B (11 in base-10) + 0 = 12 in base-10, which is C in base-16. So, we write down C.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n7 + 1 = 8 in base-10, which is 8 in base-16. So, we write down 8.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 8C7.\n\nSo, 7BF + 108 = \\boxed{8C7}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's break down the numbers C18 and B96 into their place values in base-16.\n\nC18 = (12 * 16^2) + (1 * 16^1) + (8 * 16^0) = 3072 + 16 + 8 = 3096\n\nB96 = (11 * 16^2) + (9 * 16^1) + (6 * 16^0) = 2816 + 144 + 6 = 2966\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers:\n\n3096 + 2966 = 6062\n\nNow, we need to convert this number back to base-16. To do this, we'll divide by the largest power of 16 that is less than the number and find the remainder.\n\n6062 \xf7 16^2 = 6062 \xf7 256 = 23 with a remainder of 194\n\nSo, we have 23 in the 16^2 place. Now, let's find the value for the 16^1 place:\n\n194 \xf7 16^1 = 194 \xf7 16 = 12 with a remainder of 2\n\nSo, we have 12 in the 16^1 place. Finally, let's find the value for the 16^0 place:\n\n2 \xf7 16^0 = 2 \xf7 1 = 2\n\nSo, we have 2 in the 16^0 place.\n\nNow, let's convert these values back to base-16 digits:\n\n23 = 1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0 = 17\n\n12 = C\n\n2 = 2\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\nC18 + B96 = 17C2\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{17C2}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is DAC+E86? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. F (from DAC) + 6 (from E86) = 15 + 6 = 21 in base-10. Since 21 in base-16 is 1 with a carry-over of 1, we write down 1 and carry-over 1.\n\n2. Now, we add the second digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + A (from DAC) + 8 (from E86) = 1 + 10 + 8 = 19 in base-10. Since 19 in base-16 is 3 with a carry-over of 1, we write down 3 and carry-over 1.\n\n3. Finally, we add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + D (from DAC) + E (from E86) = 1 + 13 + 14 = 28 in base-10. Since 28 in base-16 is 1C, we write down 1C.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 1C31.\n\nSo, DAC + E86 in base-16 is \\boxed{1C31}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A4B and 699 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: B + 9. Since B is 11 in base-10 and 9 is 9, we have 11 + 9 = 20. In base-16, 20 is written as 14 (1 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits: 4 + 9 + 1 (carry-over). In base-10, this is 4 + 9 + 1 = 14. In base-16, 14 is written as E. So, we write down the E.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: A + 6.

In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, so we have 12 + 5 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 17 in base-16 is written as 11, so we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: F + D + 1. In base-16, F is equivalent to 15 and D is equivalent to 13. So we have 15 + 13 + 1 = 29. Since 29 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 29 in base-16 is written as 1D, so we write down the D and carry over the other 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 6 + A + 1. In base-16, A is equivalent to 10, so we have 6 + 10 + 1 = 17. As we saw earlier, 17 in base-16 is written as 11.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get 11D1. So, 6FC + AD5 = \\boxed{11D1}.

In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is E.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit: 5 + D. In base-16, D represents 13, so we have 5 + 13 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. To find the base-16 representation of 18, we can subtract 16 from it: 18 - 16 = 2.

To add the two numbers 1EB and A89 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: B + 9. Since B is 11 in base-10 and 9 is 9, their sum is 11 + 9 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14 (1 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n2.

So, we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: 1 + A, and don't forget the carry-over 1. In base-10, A is 10, so the sum is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C (12 * 16^0).\n\nNow, we can combine the results from each column to get the final sum: C74.\n\nSo, 1EB + A89 in base-16 is \\boxed{C74}.

To add B32 and 6B3 in base-16, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 2 + 3 = 5\n2. Middle column: 3 + B. Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, we have 3 + 11 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E.\n3. Leftmost column: B + 6. Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, we have 11 + 6 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented by the digit 1 and a carry-over of 1. So, we write down 1 and carry-over 1.\n\nNow, we add the carry-over to the result:\n\n1 (carry-over)\n1E5\n\nSo, B32 + 6B3 in base-16 is equal to 1E5.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1E5}.

To add the two numbers AB3 and 7D7 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have 3 + 7.

In base-16, B represents 11 and D represents 13. So, 11 + 13 = 24. Since 24 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 24 in base-16 is 18, so we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\n3. In the leftmost column (256s place), we have A + 7 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). In base-16, A represents 10. So, 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 1 and carry over 2.\n\n4. Since we have a carry-over of 2, we need to add another digit to the left.

In base-16, this is equal to 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the 16s place) and add the numbers: D + F. In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 and F is equivalent to 15. So, 13 + 15 = 28. Since 28 is greater than 15, we need to carry over the excess to the next column. In base-16, 28 is represented as 1C (1 * 16^1 + 12 * 16^0).

Since 13 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. 13 in base-16 is D, so we write down D.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits:\n\nB + F = 11 + 15 = 26 (in base-10).

So, we write down a 4 in the 1's place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the 16's place): D + 3. In base-16, D represents the decimal number 13. So, we have 13 + 3 = 16. Since 16 is equal to 1 * 16^1, we write down a 0 in the 16's place of the result and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256's place) along with the carry-over: A + 5 + 1. In base-16, A represents the decimal number 10. So, we have 10 + 5 + 1 = 16.

Rightmost column: 3 + 0 = 3\n2. Middle column: F (which is 15 in base-10) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17. Since we are in base-16, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 1 (which is equivalent to 17 - 16) in the middle column.\n3. Leftmost column: 7 + 3 + 1 (carried over) = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the letter B.\n\nSo, the result is B13.\n\n\\boxed{B13}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): D + 8. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 8 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1(16^1) + 5(16^0), which is 15. So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place) along with the carry-over: 8 + 6 + 1. In base-10, this is 8 + 6 + 1 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented as F. So, we write down the F.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place): 8 + C. In base-10, this is 8 + 12 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 1(16^1) + 4(16^0), which is 14. So, we write down the 14.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 88D + 6C8 = \\boxed{14F5}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the two numbers C25 and A76 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 5 + 6 = B (since 5 + 6 = 11 in base-10, and 11 is represented by B in base-16).\n2. Add the middle digits: 2 + 7 = 9 (since 2 + 7 = 9 in base-10).\n3. Add the leftmost digits: C + A = 16 (since C represents 12 and A represents 10 in base-16, and 12 + 10 = 22 in base-10). Since we can't represent 16 with a single digit in base-16, we'll carry over the 1 and write down 6.\n\nSo, C25 + A76 = 16B in base-16.\n\nThe final result is \\boxed{16B}.

The rightmost column: 1 + E\nSince E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have 1 + 14 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\n2. The middle column: 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 2\nThis gives us 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. We write down 4 and don't need to carry over anything.\n\n3. The leftmost column: 9 + E\nSince E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have 9 + 14 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented by the digits 1 and 7 (since 23 = 1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0). So, we write down 17.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 17F4.\n\nSo, E11 + 92E = \\boxed{17F4}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 8 + 15 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17, so we write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented as D, so we write down the D.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: E + 0. Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 0 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented as E, so we write down the E.\n\nPutting it all together, we have E98 + 30F = \\boxed{ED7}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 6 + F + 1. Since 6 is 6, F is 15, and 1 is 1, we have 6 + 15 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), which is 16. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: D + 6 + 1. Since D is 13 in base-10, 6 is 6, and 1 is 1, we have 13 + 6 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 1(16^1) + 4(16^0), which is 14.\n\nPutting all the results together, we have 14 in the leftmost column, 6 in the middle column, and 5 in the rightmost column. So, the final result is 1465.\n\nTherefore, D6C + 6F9 = \\boxed{1465}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

But we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we need to add that as well: 13 + 1 = 14 in base-10. 14 in base-16 is E, so we write down E.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n8 + E (14 in base-10) = 8 + 14 = 22 in base-10. 22 in base-16 is 16, so we write down 16.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n84F\n+E9A\n-----\n16E9\n\nSo, 84F + E9A in base-16 is \\boxed{16E9}.

To add A70 and 1D1 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n2. Moving to the middle column (16s place), we have 7 + D. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 7 + 13 = 20 in base-10. To convert 20 back to base-16, we have 20 = 1 \xd7 16 + 4, so we write down 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n3. In the leftmost column (256s place), we have A + 1 + 1 (the carry-over). Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 in base-10.

To add F2E and D53 in base-16, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. E (14 in decimal) + 3 (3 in decimal) = 11 (17 in decimal). Since 11 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 1.\n\n2. 2 (2 in decimal) + 5 (5 in decimal) = 7 (7 in decimal). No carrying over is needed. The middle digit of the sum is 7.\n\n3. F (15 in decimal) + D (13 in decimal) = 1C (28 in decimal). Since 1C is greater than or equal to 16, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is C, and we carry over 1.\n\n4. Since we carried over 1, we need to add it to the leftmost column. 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, the sum of F2E and D53 in base-16 is 1C71.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1C71}.

To add the two numbers 98C and AED in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: C + D. Since C is 12 and D is 13 in base-10, their sum is 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0 = 19. So, we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 8 + E. Since 8 is 8 and E is 14 in base-10, their sum is 1 + 8 + 14 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 1*16^1 + 7*16^0 = 17. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 9 + A. Since 9 is 9 and A is 10 in base-10, their sum is 1 + 9 + 10 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 1*16^1 + 4*16^0 = 14. So, we write down 14.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sum 98C + AED = 1479 in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1479}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 9D2+F74? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 2 + 4. Since 2 + 4 = 6, we don't need to carry over any digits. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 6.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column: 9 + 7. Since 9 + 7 = 10, we have a carry-over. In base-16, 10 is represented by the letter A. So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + D + F. In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 and F is equivalent to 15. So, we have 1 + 13 + 15 = 29. In base-16, 29 is represented as 1D (since 1 * 16^1 + 13 * 16^0 = 29).\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 1A6. So, 9D2 + F74 in base-16 is equal to \\boxed{1A6}.

Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 9 + 12 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1(16^1) + 5(16^0), which is 15. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 8 + F + 1. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 8 + 15 + 1 = 24. In base-16, 24 is represented as 1(16^1) + 8(16^0), which is 18. So, we write down 8 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: 9 + 6 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 1(16^1) + 0(16^0), which is 10.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 185. So, 989 + 6FC = \\boxed{185}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers D1C and DBA in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. First, we'll add the rightmost digits: C + A. Since C is 12 and A is 10 in base-10, their sum is 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1*16^1 + 6*16^0, so the result is 16. We'll write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Next, we'll add the middle digits: 1 + B, plus the carry-over 1. Since B is 11 in base-10, the sum is 1 + 11 + 1 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented as D, so we'll write down the D.\n\n3. Finally, we'll add the leftmost digits: D + D. Since D is 13 in base-10, their sum is 13 + 13 = 26. In base-16, 26 is represented as 1*16^1 + A*16^0, so the result is 1A.

Add the middle digits: A + 6 + 1 (the carry-over). Since A is 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 6 + 1 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1(16) + 1, so we write down the 1 and carry over the 1.\n\n```\n  1\n   1\n  6AE\n+ E67\n-----\n   15\n```\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: 6 + E + 1 (the carry-over). Since E is 14 in base-10, we have 6 + 14 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1(16) + 5, so we write down the 15.\n\n```\n  1\n  6AE\n+ E67\n-----\n 1515\n```\n\nSo, 6AE + E67 in base-16 is \\boxed{1515}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 6E8+95E? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nColumn 1 (ones place): 8 + E\nSince E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have 8 + 14 = 22 in base-10. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 2 (16s place): 6 + 9 + 1 (carry-over)\nIn base-10, this is 6 + 9 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 1(16^1) + 0(16^0), so we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 3 (256s place): E + 5 + 1 (carry-over)\nSince E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 5 + 1 = 20 in base-10. In base-16, 20 is represented as 1(16^1) + 4(16^0), so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 4 (4096s place): 1 (carry-over)\nThere are no more digits to add, so we just write down the carry-over, which is 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 6E8 and 95E in base-16 is \\boxed{1406}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. In the rightmost column, we have 3 + A. Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, we have 3 + 10 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, we write down D and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. In the middle column, we have 0 + 1 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). This gives us 2.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have 7 + 1 (no carry-over from the previous step). This gives us 8.\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the base-16 number 82D. So, the sum of 703 and 13A in base-16 is \\boxed{82D}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n9 + 9 = 12 in base-10, which is C in base-16. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n6 + 3 = 9 in base-10. Since we carried over 1 from the previous column, we need to add that as well: 9 + 1 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-16. So, we write down A.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\nC + 9 = 12 + 9 = 21 in base-10, which is 15 + 6 = F + 6 in base-16. To add F and 6, we can think of F as 15 in base-10, so 15 + 6 = 21 in base-10, which is 1 * 16^1 + 5 in base-16. So, we write down 15 and carry over 1.\n\nSince we carried over 1 from the last column, we need to add that as well: 1 * 16^1 + 1 = 17 in base-10, which is 1 * 16^1 + 1 in base-16. So, we write down 11.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the final result:\n\nC69 + 939 = 11AC\n\nSo, the sum is \\boxed{11AC}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over:\n\n1\n\nSince there are no other numbers to add in this column, we just write down the 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n885 + 80C = \\boxed{1111} in base-16.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is BF4+7DC? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 4 + C. Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 4 + 12 = 16. Since we are in base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: F + 7 + 1. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 7 + 1 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: B + D + 1. Since B is equivalent to 11 and D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 11 + 13 + 1 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 19.\n\nPutting all the results together, we have 1907 as the sum of BF4 and 7DC in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1907}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: F + 9. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 9 is 9, we have 15 + 9 = 24. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0), so we write down the 8 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 9 + B + 1. In base-10, 9 is 9 and B is 11, so we have 9 + 11 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 15 (1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0), so we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: C + 9 + 1. In base-10, C is 12 and 9 is 9, so we have 12 + 9 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 (1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0), so we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 * 16^2 + 6 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0 + 8 * 16^(-1) = 1658 in base-16.\n\nSo, C9F + 9B9 = \\boxed{1658}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: B + E. Since B is 11 and E is 14 in base-10, we have 11 + 14 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0, which is 19. So, we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the middle digits: 5 + D + the carry-over 1. Since D is 13 in base-10, we have 5 + 13 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 1*16^1 + 3*16^0, which is 13. So, we write down the 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits: 7 + 1 + the carry-over 1. In base-10, we have 7 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{939}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nColumn 1 (ones place): 2 + A\nSince A in base-16 represents 10 in base-10, we have 2 + 10 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 2 (sixteens place): 9 + 7 + 1 (carry-over)\n9 + 7 = 16, and with the carry-over, we have 16 + 1 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented by the digit 1 and a carry-over of 1.\n\nColumn 3 (256s place): 8 + B + 1 (carry-over)\nSince B in base-16 represents 11 in base-10, we have 8 + 11 = 19. With the carry-over, we have 19 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented by the digit 1 and a carry-over of 1.\n\nColumn 4 (4096s place): 1 (carry-over)\nThere are no more digits to add, so we just write down the carry-over.\n\nSo, the sum of 892 and B7A in base-16 is \\boxed{11C1C}.

First, let's add the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n0 + 4 = 4\n\nC + A = 16 (since C is 12 and A is 10, and 12 + 10 = 22, but we are in base-16, so we carry over 1 to the next column)\n\n4 + 1 (carried over) + A = 15 (since A is 10, and 4 + 1 = 5, so 5 + 10 = 15, which is F in base-16)\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{F64}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): 2 + 5. Since 2 + 5 = 7, we can write a 7 in the ones place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the 16s place) and add the numbers: F + 3. In base-16, F represents 15, so we have 15 + 3 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. To do this, we subtract 16 from 18, which gives us 2, and then we carry over the 1 to the next column. So, we write a 2 in the 16s place of the result.\n\nFinally, let's move to the last column (the 256s place) and add the numbers, including the carry-over: 3 + D + 1. In base-16, D represents 13, so we have 3 + 13 + 1 = 17. Since 17 is within the range of base-16 digits, we can write a 1 in the 256s place of the result.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result: 1 in the 256s place, 2 in the 16s place, and 7 in the ones place.

First, let's convert the given numbers A17 and B50 from base-16 to base-10.\n\nA17 in base-16 is:\n(10 * 16^1) + (1 * 16^0) = (10 * 16) + 1 = 160 + 1 = 161 in base-10.\n\nB50 in base-16 is:\n(11 * 16^1) + (5 * 16^0) = (11 * 16) + 5 = 176 + 5 = 181 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10:\n161 + 181 = 342\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-16:\n342 \xf7 16 = 21 remainder 6 \u2192 6 in the 16^0 place\n21 \xf7 16 = 1 remainder 5 \u2192 5 in the 16^1 place\n\nSo, the result in base-16 is 56.\n\nTherefore, A17 + B50 in base-16 is \\boxed{56}.

So, we write down a 7 in the next column of the result and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: C + 5 + 1. In base-16, C represents 12 and 5 represents 5. So, 12 + 5 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12.

To add the numbers E15 and FBA in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 5 + A. Since A is 10 in base-10, 5 + A = 5 + 10 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 1 + B. Since B is 11 in base-10, 1 + 1 + B = 1 + 1 + 11 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, we write down D.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: E + F. Since E is 14 and F is 15 in base-10, E + F = 14 + 15 = 29. In base-16, 29 can be represented as 1 * 16^1 + D * 16^0, which is 1D. So, we write down 1D.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the sum E15 + FBA = 1DDF. So, the result is \\boxed{1DDF}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + C + A. In base-16, C is 12 and A is 10. So, 1 + 12 + 10 = 23. Again, this is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 23 in base-16 is 17, so we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 5 + 1. In base-16, 5 is 5 and 1 is 1. So, 1 + 5 + 1 = 7.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get 772. So, 5CB + 1A7 = \\boxed{772}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To do this, we divide 27 by 16 and find that the quotient is 1 and the remainder is B (which is 11 in base-10). So, 27 in base-10 is equal to 1B in base-16.\n\nNow, we need to carry over the 1 from the 1B to the next column (the 256's place): 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nFinally, we can write down the result by combining the digits we found in each column: 9 in the 256's place, 1B in the 16's place, and 3 in the 1's place. \n\nSo, F81 + C82 in base-16 is \\boxed{91B3}.

So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 3 + A (which is 10 in base-10) + 1 (carry-over) = 3 + 10 + 1 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the letter E. So, we write down E and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: 8 + A (which is 10 in base-10) + 1 (carry-over) = 8 + 10 + 1 = 19.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nF + F = 1E (since F is the largest digit in base-16, adding F to F gives us 1E, which is 16 + 14 = 30 in base-10)\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n9 + 0 = 9 (since there is no carry-over from the previous column)\n\nNext, let's move to the third column:\n\n5 + A = F (since A is 10 in base-10, 5 + 10 = 15, which is F in base-16)\n\nFinally, we have a carry-over of 1 from the first column, so we need to add that to the result:\n\n1 + F = 10 (since F is 15 in base-10, 1 + 15 = 16, which is 10 in base-16)\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n10F9E\n\nTherefore, the sum of 59C and A0F in base-16 is \\boxed{10F9E}.

Add the rightmost column (units place): D + 1 = E (since D is 13 and 1 is 1, their sum is 14, which is E in base-16).\n2. Add the middle column (16s place): 6 + D = 6 + 13 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 19 in base-16 is 13, which is D, and we carry over 1 to the next column.\n3. Add the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: F + 5 + 1 = 15 + 5 + 1 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is 15 with a carry-over of 1, which is F, and we carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is 1FDE. Therefore, F6D + 5D1 = \\boxed{1FDE}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  1D2\n+ D80\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n2 + 0 = 2\n\nNext, let's move to the middle column:\n\nD + 8 = 13 + 8 = 21. Since we are in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remainder, which is 5:\n\n  1\n  1D2\n+ D80\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n1 + D + 1 = 1 + 13 + 1 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the letter F:\n\n  F\n  1D2\n+ D80\n\nSo, the result of the addition is:\n\n  F52\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{F52}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the two numbers AB6 and 5D2 in base-16, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 6 + 2 = 8. So, the rightmost digit of the result is 8.\n\n2. Add the middle digits: B + D. Since B is 11 and D is 13 in base-10, their sum is 11 + 13 = 24. In base-16, 24 is represented as 18 (1 * 16^1 + 8 * 16^0). So, we'll write down 8 as the middle digit and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: A + 5 + 1. Since A is 10 in base-10, the sum is 10 + 5 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10 (1 * 16^1 + 0 * 16^0). So, we'll write down 0 as the leftmost digit and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n4.

Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 3 + 14 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11, so we write down 1 and carry over the other 1.\n\nNext, we add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 4 + D + 1. D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, so we have 4 + 13 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we just write down the carry-over 1 in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, 435 + DE4 = \\boxed{1219}.

In base-16, A represents 10, so 10 + 4 = 14, which is represented by E in base-16. So, we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: F + E + 1. In base-16, F represents 15, and E represents 14, so 15 + 14 + 1 = 30. In base-16, 30 is represented by 1E (1 * 16^1 + 14 * 16^0). So, we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: F + E + 1. As before, F represents 15, and E represents 14, so 15 + 14 + 1 = 30. In base-16, 30 is represented by 1E.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get 1EE. So, FFA + EE4 = \\boxed{1EE}.

Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 1 = 16.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nC (12 in base-10) + 9 = 12 + 9 = 21. Since we are in base-16, we carry over 1 and write down 5 (21 in base-10 is 15 in base-16).\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carried over) + 8 + 3 = 1 + 8 + 3 = 12. Since 12 is already a base-16 digit (C), we don't need to carry over anything.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n6 + E (14 in base-10) = 6 + 14 = 20.

To add F44 and 32A in base-16, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 4 + A. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 4 + 10 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is E.\n\n2. Add the middle digits: 4 + 2. This is a simple addition, and we get 4 + 2 = 6. So, the middle digit of the sum is 6.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: F + 3. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 3 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, which is written as 1(16^1) + 2(16^0). So, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist in this case), and the leftmost digit of the sum is 2.\n\nSince we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final sum is 1(16^2) + 2(16^1) + 6(16^0) + E(16^0), which simplifies to 162E in base-16.\n\nTherefore, F44 + 32A in base-16 is \\boxed{162E}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers DAD and A3A in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Rightmost column: D + A. Since D is 13 and A is 10, we have 13 + 10 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17 (1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0). So, we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Middle column: A + 3 + 1 (carry-over). Since A is 10, we have 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented as E. So, we write down E and there is no carry-over.\n\n3. Leftmost column: D + A. Since D is 13 and A is 10, we have 13 + 10 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17 (1 * 16^1 + 7 * 16^0). So, we write down 17.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result: 17E7.\n\nSo, DAD + A3A in base-16 is \\boxed{17E7}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): F + C. Since F is 15 and C is 12 in base-10, their sum is 27. In base-16, 27 is represented as 1B.

So, we write down 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 2 + 5. In base-10, this is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8. In base-16, 8 is represented as 8.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 87B. So, 2FF + 57C = \\boxed{87B}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0, which is 19. So, we write down 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNext, let's add the middle digits: 9 + 4 + the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented as E. So, we write down E.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits: D + 5. Since D is 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 5 = 18.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers vertically, just like we would in base-10:\n\n```\n  2DE\n+ E4D\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have E + D. In base-16, E is 14 and D is 13, so E + D = 14 + 13 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 27 in base-16 is 1B, so we write down B and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  2DE\n+ E4D\n-----\n    B\n```\n\nNext, we add the middle digits, D and 4, along with the carry-over 1. In base-16, D is 13, so we have 13 + 4 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 18 in base-16 is 12, so we write down 2 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n   1\n  2DE\n+ E4D\n-----\n   2B\n```\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, 2 and E, along with the carry-over 1. In base-16, E is 14, so we have 2 + 14 + 1 = 17. 17 in base-16 is 11, so we write down 11:\n\n```\n  1\n   1\n  2DE\n+ E4D\n-----\n 112B\n```\n\nSo, 2DE + E4D in base-16 is 112B.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 4 + 5 = 9. So, the rightmost digit of the result is 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column: A + B. In base-16, A represents 10 and B represents 11. So, 10 + 11 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is represented as 15 + 1, which is F + 1. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: E + C + 1. In base-16, E represents 14 and C represents 12. So, 14 + 12 + 1 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15, we need to represent it in base-16. 27 in base-16 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + B (11), which is 1B.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 1BF9.\n\nSo, EA4 + CB5 = \\boxed{1BF9}.

Since A in base-16 represents 10 in base-10, we have 0 + 10 = 10. In base-16, 10 is represented by A. So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 6 + C + 1. In base-16, C represents 12 in base-10. So, we have 6 + 12 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented by 13, which is D. So, we write down D and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: 8 + D + 1. In base-16, D represents 13 in base-10. So, we have 8 + 13 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented by 16 + 6, which is 1(16) + 6, or 16.\n\nSo, the sum of 860 and DCA in base-16 is 1DA.

First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nD + F = 13 + 15 = 28 (in base-10). Since 28 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 28 in base-16 is 1C, so we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's move to the next column:\n\nE + 7 + 1 (carry over) = 14 + 7 + 1 = 22 (in base-10). Again, this is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the last column:\n\nE + F + 1 (carry over) = 14 + 15 + 1 = 30 (in base-10). This time, there's no need to carry over since 30 is less than 16^2. 30 in base-16 is 1E.\n\nSo, the sum of EED and F7F in base-16 is 1E6C. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{1E6C}.

In base-10, this is 1 + 1 = 2. In base-16, 2 is represented as 2.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get the final sum: 213. So, 1CA + 4B9 = \\boxed{213}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the two numbers D1E and D86 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Rightmost column (ones place): E + 6\nE is 14 in base-10, and 6 is 6 in base-10. So, 14 + 6 = 20 in base-10. Since 20 in base-16 is 14 (1*16^1 + 4*16^0), we write down 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n2.

B + 7: Since B in base-16 represents 11 in base-10 and 7 represents 7, we have 11 + 7 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. (1 carried over) + 9 + 1: In base-16, 9 represents 9 and 1 represents 1. So, we have 1 (carried over) + 9 + 1 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented as B, so we write down B and don't need to carry over anything.\n\n3. E + F: In base-16, E represents 14 and F represents 15. So, we have 14 + 15 = 29. In base-16, 29 is represented as 1D, so we write down D and carry over the 1.\n\n4. (1 carried over) + nothing: We just have the 1 carried over, so we write down 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1D2B. So, 9EB + F17 in base-16 is \\boxed{1D2B}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 4CF+423? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): F + 3. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 3 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place): 4 + 2 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place): C + 4. Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 12 + 4 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10, so we write down a 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince we have a carry-over of 1 in the 256s place, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final result is 1 in the 4096s place, 0 in the 256s place, 7 in the 16s place, and 2 in the ones place.\n\nThus, the sum of 4CF and 423 in base-16 is \\boxed{1072}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  359\n+ 1A3\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 9 + 3 = 12 in base-10, which is C in base-16. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\n  359\n+ 1A3\n-----\n    C\n\n2. 5 + A (which is 10 in base-10) + 1 (carry over) = 16 in base-10, which is 10 in base-16. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\n  359\n+ 1A3\n-----\n   0C\n\n3. 3 + 1 + 1 (carry over) = 5 in base-16. So, we write down 5.\n\n  359\n+ 1A3\n-----\n  50C\n\nSo, the sum of 359 and 1A3 in base-16 is \\boxed{50C}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 35D and 50B into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n35D in base-16 is equal to (3 \xd7 16^2) + (5 \xd7 16^1) + (13 \xd7 16^0) = (3 \xd7 256) + (5 \xd7 16) + 13 = 768 + 80 + 13 = 861 in base-10.\n\n50B in base-16 is equal to (5 \xd7 16^2) + (0 \xd7 16^1) + (11 \xd7 16^0) = (5 \xd7 256) + 11 = 1280 + 11 = 1291 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the base-10 equivalents: 861 + 1291 = 2152.\n\nNow, we need to convert 2152 back to base-16.\n\n2152 \xf7 16^2 = 2152 \xf7 256 = 8 with a remainder of 104.\n\n104 \xf7 16^1 = 104 \xf7 16 = 6 with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, the base-16 equivalent of 2152 is 868.\n\nTherefore, 35D + 50B in base-16 is \\boxed{868}.

So, we write down E and carry over nothing.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16's place): 1 + E. In base-16, 1 + E = F. So, we write down F and carry over nothing.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256's place): 3 + C. In base-16, 3 + C = F. So, we write down F and carry over nothing.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 316 + CE8 = \\boxed{FFE}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Rightmost column: 1 + 8 = 9\n2. Middle column: D + 7 = 13 + 7 = 20. Since we are in base-16, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 (20 - 16) in the middle column.\n3. Leftmost column: 1 (carried over) + D = 1 + 13 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the letter E.\n\nSo, DD1 + D78 = E49.\n\nThe result is \\boxed{E49}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 3 + 15 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + A + 8. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 1 + 10 + 8 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down a 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 4 + C. C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, so we have 1 + 4 + 12 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 11, so we write down a 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 (carry-over) 3 2, which is 132 in base-16. So, 4A3 + C8F = \\boxed{1132}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add B38 and D69 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column (ones place): 8 + 9. In base-16, 8 + 9 = 11, which is represented by the digit B. So, write down B and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. Move to the next column (16s place): 3 + 6 + 1 (carry-over). In base-16, 3 + 6 = 9, and 9 + 1 = A. So, write down A and no need to carry over.\n\n3. Move to the next column (256s place): B + D. In base-16, B is 11 and D is 13. So, 11 + 13 = 24, which is represented by 1(16) + 8, or 18 in base-16. So, write down 8 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n4. Since we have a carry-over, we need to add one more column (4096s place): 1 (carry-over). Write down 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A8B. Therefore, B38 + D69 = \\boxed{1A8B}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nC + A = 12 + 10 = 22 (in base-10). Since 22 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's move to the next column:\n\nE + F + 1 (carry over) = 14 + 15 + 1 = 30 (in base-10). Again, 30 is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 30 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 14, so we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n2 + D + 1 (carry over) = 2 + 13 + 1 = 16 (in base-10). 16 in base-16 is 1 * 16^1 + 0, so we write down 10.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n2EC\n+DFA\n-----\n 10E6\n\nSo, 2EC + DFA = \\boxed{10E6}.

To add the two numbers 72E and A52 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have E + 2. In base-16, E represents 14 and 2 represents 2. So, 14 + 2 = 16. Since 16 is the base, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\n2. In the next column, we have 2 + 5, plus the carry-over 1. In base-16, 2 represents 2 and 5 represents 5. So, 2 + 5 + 1 = 8. We write down an 8 and there is no carry-over this time.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have 7 + A. In base-16, 7 represents 7 and A represents 10. So, 7 + 10 = 17. Since 17 is greater than the base, we need to carry over. 17 in base-16 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0, which is 11 in base-16. So, we write down a 1 and carry over a 1.\n\n4. Since we have a carry-over, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final result is 1180.\n\nThus, the sum of 72E and A52 in base-16 is \\boxed{1180}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

This gives us 9 + 2 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C. So, we write down the C.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits: A + 2. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 2 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C.\n\nSo, the sum of 9A7 and 23F in base-16 is \\boxed{CC6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + 6 = 1 + 9 + 6 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nSince we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left.\n\nSo, the final result is 1F2F.\n\nTherefore, 9F9 + 626 = \\boxed{1F2F}.

Since E is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 8 + 14 = 22 in base-10. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), so 22 in base-16 is 16. We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16's place) along with the carry-over: A + C + 1. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, and C is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So we have 10 + 12 + 1 = 23 in base-10. In base-16, 23 is represented as 1(16^1) + 7(16^0), so 23 in base-16 is 17.

Finally, we have D (13 in decimal) + B (11 in decimal) = 24 in decimal. In base-16, 24 is represented as 1*16^1 + 8*16^0, which is 18. So, we write down 18.\n\nPutting it all together, we have D41 + B3E = \\boxed{18F7}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, 8 is 8 and E represents the decimal number 14. So, we have 8 + 14 = 22. Since 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: F + 5 + 1. In base-16, F represents the decimal number 15. So, we have 15 + 5 + 1 = 21. Since 21 in base-16 is 16 + 5, we write down 15, which is F in base-16.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum F8A + 5E0 = F6A. So, the result is \\boxed{F6A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 6 + 7.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: 4 + F. Since F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 4 + 15 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the middle digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + A + 7. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 1 + 10 + 7 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 1 + D.

Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10 and 8 is equivalent to 8, we have 13 + 8 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 15, so we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place) along with the carry-over: 9 + F + 1. Since 9 is equivalent to 9, F is equivalent to 15, and 1 is equivalent to 1, we have 9 + 15 + 1 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 19, so we write down the 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 1. Since 3 is equivalent to 3 and 1 is equivalent to 1, we have 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get the final sum: 495. So, 9FD + 3E8 = \\boxed{495}.

First, let's add the two numbers vertically, just like we would do in base-10:\n\n```\n  31B\n+ B9A\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have B + A. Since A is 10 and B is 11 in base-10, B + A = 21 in base-10. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0 = 15, so we write down 5 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  31B\n+ B9A\n-----\n    5\n```\n\nNow, let's add the middle digits: 1 + 1 (the carry-over) + 9. This gives us 11 in base-10, which is B in base-16. So, we write down B:\n\n```\n   1\n  31B\n+ B9A\n-----\n   B5\n```\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits: 3 + B. Since B is 11 in base-10, 3 + B = 3 + 11 = 14 in base-10. In base-16, 14 is represented as E. So, we write down E:\n\n```\n  31B\n+ B9A\n-----\n  EB5\n```\n\nSo, 31B + B9A in base-16 is \\boxed{EB5}.

Since we are in base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\n3. 1 (carry-over) + 3 + 7 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented as B.\n\nSo, the sum is B05.

B (11 in base-10) + 7 = 11 + 7 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. So, we write down 2 (18 in base-16) and carry over 1.\n\n2. In the next column, we have 9 + 0 + 1 (the carry-over) = 9 + 1 = A (10 in base-10).\n\n3. In the last column, we have 6 + D (13 in base-10) = 6 + 13 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. So, we write down 3 (19 in base-16) and carry over 1.\n\n4. Finally, we write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, the sum is 13A2.

To add the two numbers A0B and DBA in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost column: B + A. Since B + A = 15 + 10 = 25, which is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 25 in base-16 is 19 (1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0). So, we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\n2.

Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, we have 3 + 10 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D. So, we write down D and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: D + 6 + 1. Since D in base-16 represents the decimal number 13, we have 13 + 6 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented by the number 14, which is the digit E. So, we write down E and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: F + 7 + 1.

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit: 3 + 7. In base-10, this would be 10, but we need to convert it to base-16. Since 10 in base-16 is represented by the letter A, we have 3 + 7 = A. We don't need to carry over any value since A is less than the base (16).\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost digits: 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 234 + 575 = \\boxed{7A9}.

So, we write down 9 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: B + 7 + 1. Since B is 11 in base-10, their sum is 11 + 7 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 1*16^1 + 3*16^0, which is 13. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: D + 5 + 1. Since D is 13 in base-10, their sum is 13 + 5 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 1*16^1 + 3*16^0, which is 13.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get the final sum: 1339.

Since F is 15 in base-10 and 7 is 7, we have 15 + 7 = 22 in base-10. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), so 22 in base-16 is 16. We write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the next column (the 16s place) along with the carry-over: C + 3 + 1. In base-10, C is 12, so we have 12 + 3 + 1 = 16 in base-10. In base-16, 16 is represented as 1(16^1) + 0(16^0), so 16 in base-16 is 10. We write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 1. In base-10, this is just 2 + 1 = 3. Since 3 is the same in both base-10 and base-16, we write down the 3.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 306.\n\nSo, 2CF + 3A7 in base-16 is \\boxed{306} in base-16.

In base-16, this is equivalent to 1 + 3 in base-10, which is 4.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column. We have 1 + B. In base-16, this is equivalent to 1 + 11 in base-10, which is 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C.\n\nSo, the sum is CB4B. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{CB4B}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Rightmost column: 1 + 8 = 9.\n\n2. Middle column: 3 + D. Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 3 + 13 = 16. Since we are in base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. Leftmost column: F + 4 + 1 (carry-over). Since F in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 15 + 4 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 14.\n\nSo, the sum of F31 and 4D8 in base-16 is 1409.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1409}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): 8 + 1. Since 8 + 1 = 9, we can write a 9 in the ones place of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the 16s place) and add the numbers: F + 6. We know that F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, so we have 15 + 6 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 15, we need to carry over to the next column. To find the digit to write in the 16s place, we can subtract 16 from 21: 21 - 16 = 5. So, we write a 5 in the 16s place and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: 4 + 7 + 1 = 12.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column: 9 + 7 = 10. However, since we are in base-16, we need to represent 10 as a single digit. In base-16, 10 is represented by the letter "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, we add the carried-over 1 to the leftmost column: 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 9F2 and E74 in base-16 is 1A6. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{1A6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over:\n\n7 + 4 + 1 (carry-over) = 12\n\n12 in base-16 is represented by the letter C.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\nC55\n\nTherefore, 7E2 + 473 in base-16 is \\boxed{C55}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nF (15 in base 10) + 6 = 1B (27 in base 10)\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\nD (13 in base 10) + 8 + 1 (from the previous column) = 16 (22 in base 10)\n\nSince 16 is a two-digit number in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost column.\n\n3 + 7 + 1 (from the previous column) = B (11 in base 10)\n\nPutting all the results together, we get:\n\n3DF + 786 = B16B\n\nSo, the final result is \\boxed{B16B}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): C + 4. Since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 12 + 4 = 16. Since 16 is equal to the base, we carry over a 1 to the next column and write down a 0 in the ones place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (the 16s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 9 + 3. In base-10, this is 1 + 9 + 3 = 13. Since 13 is less than the base (16), we don't need to carry over any value and can write down the 13 directly as "D" in the 16s place.\n\nSo, the result of 91C + 3F4 in base-16 is \\boxed{D10}.

In base-16, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 2 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (16s place) along with the carry-over: D + 7 + 1. In base-16, D represents 13, so we have 13 + 7 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented by the digits 1 and 5 (since 21 = 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0). So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place) along with the carry-over: A + 1. In base-16, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 1 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: B5C. So, ADA + D72 in base-16 is \\boxed{B5C}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nA + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17. Since we are in base-16, we carry over 1 and write down 1 as the rightmost digit.\n\nNext, we add the second digits along with the carry-over:\n\n5 + 9 + 1 (carry-over) = 14 + 9 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17. So, we carry over 1 and write down 7 as the second digit.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 5 = 6. We write down 6 as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the sum of 57A and F97 in base-16 is \\boxed{671}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): 8 + A. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, we have 8 + 10 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place) along with the carry-over: D + 5 + 1. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 13 + 5 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down a 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: E + C + 1. Since E is equivalent to 14 and C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 14 + 12 + 1 = 27. In base-16, 27 is represented as 1B.\n\nSo, the sum of ED8 and 5CA in base-16 is 1B32.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n6 + 9 = 15, which is F in base-16. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + A + 3 = 1 + 10 + 3 = 14, which is E in base-16. So, we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + C + E = 1 + 12 + 14 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15, we need to represent it in base-16. To do this, we divide 27 by 16:\n\n27 \xf7 16 = 1 remainder 11\n\nSo, 27 in base-16 is 1B.\n\nNow, let's put all the results together: 1B, E, and F.\n\nSo, CA6 + E39 = \\boxed{1BEF}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 3 + 5. In base-10, this would be 8, and since 8 is a valid digit in base-16, we can keep it as is. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column: 6 + D. In base-10, 6 is 6 and D is 13. So, 6 + 13 = 19. Since 19 is greater than the highest digit in base-16 (F, which is 15), we need to carry over. To do this, we subtract 16 from 19, which gives us 3. So, the second digit of the sum is 3, and we carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 5 + 4 + 1. In base-10, this would be 10. In base-16, 10 is represented by the digit A.

Start with the rightmost column (ones place): F + 6. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 6 is 6, their sum is 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1*16^1 + 5*16^0 = 16 + 5 = 1B. So, we write down B and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Move to the middle column (16s place): 1 (carried over) + 1 + 7. In base-10, this is 1 + 1 + 7 = 9. In base-16, 9 is simply 9, so we write down 9.\n\n3. Move to the leftmost column (256s place): A + D. In base-10, this is 10 + 13 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 1*16^1 + 7*16^0 = 16 + 7 = 17.

First, let's break down the numbers 27C and 7D0 into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n27C in base-16 means (2 \xd7 16^2) + (7 \xd7 16^1) + (12 \xd7 16^0) = (512) + (112) + (12) = 636 in base-10.\n\n7D0 in base-16 means (7 \xd7 16^2) + (13 \xd7 16^1) + (0 \xd7 16^0) = (1792) + (208) + (0) = 2000 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the base-10 equivalents: 636 + 2000 = 2636.\n\nNow, we need to convert 2636 back to base-16.\n\nTo do this, we'll divide 2636 by increasing powers of 16 and find the remainders:\n\n2636 \xf7 16^0 = 2636 \xf7 1 = 2636 with a remainder of 0.\n\n2636 \xf7 16^1 = 2636 \xf7 16 = 164 with a remainder of 12. (12 in base-16 is C)\n\n164 \xf7 16^2 = 164 \xf7 256 = 0 with a remainder of 164.\n\nNow, we'll use the remainders to construct the base-16 number:\n\n164 \xd7 16^2 = A40\n12 \xd7 16^1 = C0\n0 \xd7 16^0 = 0\n\nAdding these together, we get A40 + C0 + 0 = A4C.\n\nSo, 27C + 7D0 in base-16 is \\boxed{A4C}.

First, let's add the two numbers in base-16:\n\n  399\n+ 0B1\n_____\nNow, we start by adding the rightmost digits: 9 + 1 = A (which is 10 in base-10). So, we write A in the rightmost position:\n\n  399\n+ 0B1\n_____\n  A\n\nNext, we add the middle digits: 9 + B. Since B is 11 in base-10, we have 9 + 11 = 1A (which is 20 in base-10). So, we write A in the middle position and carry over the 1:\n\n  1\n  399\n+ 0B1\n_____\n 1A\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: 3 + 0 + 1 = 4.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: C + 2. In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So, we have 12 + 2 = 14. In base-16, 14 is represented by the digit E. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is E.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column: F + B. In base-16, F is equivalent to 15 and B is equivalent to 11. So, we have 15 + 11 = 26. Since 26 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. To find the carry-over value, we divide 26 by 16, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 10. In base-16, 10 is represented by the digit A. So, the second digit of the sum is A, and we carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 8AE.

E + 3: Since E in base-16 represents 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 3 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0 = 11. So, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1.\n\n2. B (with the carry-over 1) + 1: B in base-16 represents 11 in base-10. So, we have 11 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C. We write down the C.\n\n3. 4: Since there are no more digits to add in the leftmost position, we simply write down the 4.\n\nSo, the result is 4C1. Therefore, BEB + 413 in base-16 is \\boxed{4C1}.

We know that 23 = (1 \xd7 16^1) + (7 \xd7 16^0), so 23 in base-16 is 17. We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (256s place), including the carry-over:\n\n6 + 5 + 1 = 12\n\nSince 12 is already a valid digit in base-16, we don't need to convert it.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{1299}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 0 + 13 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: E + 1 (we carry over the 1 from the previous step). Since E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 1 = 15.

So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 0 + F. Since F is 15 in base-10, the sum is 1 + 0 + 15 = 16. Again, this is 1(16^1) + 0(16^0), so we write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + C + D. Since C is 12 in base-10 and D is 13, their sum is 1 + 12 + 13 = 26. In base-16, 26 is represented as 1(16^1) + A(16^0), or simply 1A.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 1A06.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n0 + A: Since A in base-16 represents the decimal number 10, 0 + A = A.\n\n7 + 9: In base-16, 7 + 9 = 10, which is represented by the digit A.

Rightmost column: 3 + D\n   Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 3 + 13 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. Middle column: E + 6 + 1 (carry-over)\n   E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10. So, we have 14 + 6 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 15. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. Leftmost column: F + 1 (carry-over)\n   F in base-16 is equivalent to 15 in base-10. So, we have 15 + 1 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 10. So, we write down 10.\n\nNow, putting all the columns together, we get the result: 1050.\n\nSo, FE3 + 6ED in base-16 is \\boxed{1050}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is 60F+9D7? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): F + 7. Since F is 15 in base-10 and 7 is 7, we have 15 + 7 = 22 in base-10. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), so 22 in base-16 is 16. We carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (16s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 0 + 9. In base-10, this is 1 + 0 + 9 = 10. In base-16, 10 is represented as A, so we have A in the 16s place.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (256s place): 6 + 0. In base-10, this is 6 + 0 = 6. In base-16, 6 is represented as 6.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we have 6 in the 256s place, A in the 16s place, and 6 in the units place. So, 60F + 9D7 = 6A6.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{6A6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n9 + 6 = 15, which is F in base-16. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + B + 6 = 1 + 11 + 6 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 18 in base-16 is equal to 12, which is C. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 = 10, which is A in base-16.\n\nSo, the final result is ACDF.\n\nTherefore, B19 + 966 = \\boxed{ACDF}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add B3C and 218 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column (ones place): C + 8. Since C is 12 in base-10 and 8 is 8, we have 12 + 8 = 20. In base-16, 20 is written as 14 (1*16^1 + 4*16^0). So, we write down 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Move to the middle column (16s place): 3 + 1 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. In base-16, 5 is just 5, so we write down 5 and don't need to carry over anything.\n\n3. Move to the leftmost column (256s place): B + 2. Since B is 11 in base-10 and 2 is 2, we have 11 + 2 = 13. In base-16, 13 is written as D.\n\nNow, putting the results together, we have D54 as the sum of B3C and 218 in base-16.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{D54}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the ones place): 1 + 0. In base-16, this is simply 1. So, we write down a 1 and carry over nothing.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 16s place): 6A + 4. In base-16, A represents the decimal number 10. So, we have 6 * 10 + 4 = 64. In base-16, 64 is represented as 4 * 16 + 0, which is 40. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 4.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 256s place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 8 + 4. In base-16, this is E. So, we write down an E.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{E01}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is AD8+887? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the rightmost digits: 8 + 7. In base-10, this would be 15, which is F in base-16. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F, and there is no carry.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit: D + 8. In base-10, this would be 13 + 8 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0 = 16 + 5 = 21. So, the digit in this place is 5, and we have a carry of 1.\n\nNext, let's add the leftmost digits along with the carry: A + 8 + 1. In base-10, this would be 10 + 8 + 1 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 3 * 16^0 = 16 + 3 = 19. So, the digit in this place is 3, and there is no carry.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum AD8 + 887 = 3F5. So, the result is \\boxed{3F5}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-16, we write down the digit 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNext, we add the second digits along with the carry-over:\n\n5 + 6 + 1 (carry-over) = 12. We write down the digit C (which represents 12 in base-16) and carry over the 0 (since there is no carry-over in this case).\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits:\n\n5 + 5 = 10. We write down the digit A (which represents 10 in base-16).\n\nSo, the sum of 557 and F6F in base-16 is \\boxed{AC2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + B = 7 + 11 (since B is equivalent to 11 in base-10)\nThis results in 18 in base-10, which is equivalent to 12 in base-16. So, we write down 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 7 + 8 = 1 + 7 + 8 = 16 in base-10, which is equivalent to 10 in base-16. So, we write down 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + C + D = 1 + 12 + 13 (since C is equivalent to 12 and D is equivalent to 13 in base-10)\nThis results in 26 in base-10, which is equivalent to 1A in base-16. So, we write down 1A.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result:\n\nC77 + D8B = 1A02\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{1A02}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-16, B represents 11 and A represents 10. So, 11 + 10 = 21 in base-10. To express 21 in base-16, we have 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0, which is 15 in base-16. So, the middle digit of the sum is 5, and we carry-over the 1.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have B + F + the carry-over 1. In base-16, F represents 15. So, 11 + 15 + 1 = 27 in base-10. To express 27 in base-16, we have 1 * 16^1 + B * 16^0, which is 1B in base-16.

Middle column: 3 + F + 1 (carried over)\nIn base-16, F represents the decimal number 15. So, we have 3 + 15 + 1 = 19. To express 19 in base-16, we write 13, which is 1 * 16^1 + 3 * 16^0. So, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 3.\n\n3. Leftmost column: 6 + A + 1 (carried over)\nIn base-16, A represents the decimal number 10. So, we have 6 + 10 + 1 = 17.
