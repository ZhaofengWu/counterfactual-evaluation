So far, we have 04 as the last two digits of the result.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (2 and 6) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). We have 2 + 6 + 1 = 11 in base-10.

Leftmost digit (81s place): 8 + 5. Since 8 + 5 = 13 in base-10, we need to convert 13 to base-9. 13 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-9 (1 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0). So, we write down 14.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 14 in the 81s place, 3 in the nines place, and 2 in the units place. Therefore, 814 + 518 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{1432}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n8 + 7 = 15 (base-9). Since 15 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (8), we need to carry over. 15 in base-9 is represented as 16, so we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's move to the next place value:\n\n(1 + 5) + 1 = 7 (base-9). There's no need to carry over here since 7 is within the base-9 digit range.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost place value:\n\n7 + 3 = 10 (base-9). Since 10 is greater than the highest digit in base-9 (8), we need to carry over. 10 in base-9 is represented as 11, so we write down the 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we have the result:\n\n1 (carry over) | 1 (leftmost place value) | 7 (middle place value) | 6 (rightmost place value)\n\nSo, 758 + 317 in base-9 is \\boxed{1176}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 366+857? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6+7)\nSince 6+7=13 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the sum. So far, we have: _ _ 3\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (6+5) and the carry-over (1)\n6+5+1=12 in base-10. Since 12 in base-9 is represented as 13 (1*9^1 + 3*9^0), we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 3 as the middle digit of the sum. Now we have: _ 3 3\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (3+8) and the carry-over (1)\n3+8+1=12 in base-10. Since 12 in base-9 is represented as 13 (1*9^1 + 3*9^0), we write down 13 as the leftmost digits of the sum. Now we have: 1 3 3\n\nSo, 366+857 in base-9 is \\boxed{1333}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 838+405? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the units place): 8 + 5. Since we are in base-9, we know that 8 is the highest digit, so 8 + 5 would be equivalent to 13 in base-10. However, we need to convert this to base-9. In base-9, 13 is represented as 14 (since 1 * 9^1 + 4 * 9^0 = 13). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 9s place): 3 + 0 + 1 (the carry-over). This gives us 4. Since 4 is a valid digit in base-9, we don't need to carry over anything.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 81s place): 8 + 4. This gives us 12. In base-9, 12 is represented as 13 (since 1 * 9^1 + 3 * 9^0 = 12).\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: \\boxed{1344}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n0 + 2 = 2 (ones place)\n\n5 + 4 = 11 (tens place). Since we are in base-9, we carry over the 1 to the next place value and keep the 1 in the tens place.\n\n6 + 3 + 1 (from the carry over) = 10 (hundreds place). Again, since we are in base-9, we carry over the 1 to the next place value and keep the 0 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, we have a 1 in the thousands place from the carry over.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{1012}.

Since 15 is greater than 8, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carried over) + 4 + 1 = 6 (base-9). There's no need to carry over anything this time.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n7 + 2 = 9 (base-9). Since 9 is equal to 10 in base-9, we need to carry over 1 to the next column (which doesn't exist yet). So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have 1 (carried over) at the beginning, which gives us the final result:\n\n\\boxed{1065}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6+8)\nSince 6+8 = 14 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 as the rightmost digit of the result.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (8+1) and the carry-over (1)\n8+1+1 = 10 in base-10. Since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 1 as the middle digit of the result.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (6+1) and the carry-over (1)\n6+1+1 = 8 in base-9.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the units place (4 + 8)\nSince 4 + 8 = 12 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 2 in the units place. So far, we have 2.\n\nStep 2: Add the tens place (7 + 3) and the carry-over from the previous step (1)\n7 + 3 + 1 = 11 in base-10. Since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 2 in the tens place. So far, we have 22.\n\nStep 3: Add the hundreds place (8 + 1) and the carry-over from the previous step (1)\n8 + 1 + 1 = 10 in base-10. Since we are working in base-9, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 1 in the hundreds place. So far, we have 122.\n\nStep 4: Since there is a carry-over of 1, we need to add a new digit to the left. So, we have 1122.\n\nTherefore, 874 + 138 in base-9 is \\boxed{1122}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (4 and 5). Since 4 + 5 = 9, we have a carry-over of 1. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 0.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (8 and 6) along with the carry-over from the previous step (1). Since 8 + 6 + 1 = 15, we have a carry-over of 1. So, the middle digit of the sum is 6.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (7 and 4) along with the carry-over from the previous step (1). Since 7 + 4 + 1 = 12, we have a carry-over of 1. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is 3.\n\nNow, we have the final sum: \\boxed{360}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 (ones place) + 7 (ones place) = 14 (in base-9, this is 15 since there is no digit 9). So, we write down 5 in the ones place and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\n1 (carried over) + 1 (tens place) + 4 (tens place) = 6 (in base-9). So, we write down 6 in the tens place.\n\nNow, we move to the hundreds place. There is nothing to carry over, so we just write down the 6 from the hundreds place of the first number.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 665 as the sum of 617 and 647 in base-9.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{665}.

Write down the 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 4 + 4 + 1. This is 9 in base-10, which is 10 in base-9 (1 in the next column and 0 in the current column). Write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (81s place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 8 + 1. This is 12 in base-10, which is 13 in base-9 (1 in the next column and 3 in the current column). Write down the 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we can write down the carry-over as the leftmost digit.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n0 + 7 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n8 + 5 = 13 in base-10.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost digit (1s place): 1 + 8. Since 8 is the highest digit in base-9, adding 1 to it will result in a 0 in the 1s place and a carry-over of 1 to the next place value. So, we have 0 in the 1s place and carry-over 1.\n\n2. Middle digit (9s place): 2 + 0 + 1 (carry-over). This results in 3 in the 9s place, with no carry-over.\n\n3. Leftmost digit (81s place): 7 + 3. This results in 10 in base-9, which is not a valid digit. To convert it to a valid base-9 digit, we add another place value to the left and write 10 as 1 * 9^1 + 0 * 9^0, which is 10 in base-9. So, we have 1 in the 729s place.\n\nPutting all the place values together, we get the result: \\boxed{1030}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column (nines place): 6 + 7. In base-9, this would be 13, but we need to carry over the 1 to the next column. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (81s place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9. However, since we are in base-9, we cannot have a digit of 9. Instead, we carry over the 1 to the next column and write down 0.\n\nFinally, we have a carry-over of 1 in the 729s place. So, our final result is 1033 in base-9.\n\nThus, the sum is \\boxed{1033}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 1 + 8 = 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value (thousands place) and write a 0 in the hundreds place of the sum.\n\nSo, the sum of 133 and 844 in base-9 is \\boxed{1077}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n8 (units) + 8 (units) = 16 (in base-10). Since we are working in base-9, we carry over the 1 and write down the 6. So, we have:\n\n  348\n+ 568\n------\n    6\n\nNow, let's move to the next place value, the tens place.\n\n4 (tens) + 6 (tens) = 10 (in base-10). We need to convert this to base-9, which is 11 (1 nine and 1 one).

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n0 + 4 = 4 (ones place)\n\n4 + 2 = 6 (nines place)\n\nNow, when we add the leftmost digits, we have:\n\n4 + 8 = 12 (in base-10)\n\nSince we are working in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value and write down the 2:\n\n1 (carry-over)\n2 (eighty-ones place)\n\nSo, the sum of 440 and 824 in base-9 is:\n\n1,262\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1262}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 0 + 3. Since 0 + 3 = 3, we write down a 3 in the units place of the result.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column (nines place): 5 + 6. Since 5 + 6 = 11, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over. In base-9, 11 is represented as 12 (since 1 * 9^1 + 2 * 9^0 = 11). So, we write down a 2 in the nines place of the result and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (81s place) along with the carry-over: 4 + 5 + 1. Since 4 + 5 + 1 = 10, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over again. In base-9, 10 is represented as 11 (since 1 * 9^1 + 1 * 9^0 = 10). So, we write down 11 in the 81s place of the result.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result: \\boxed{1123}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-9, we know that 9 is represented as 10. So, 6 + 7 = 13 in base-9, which is equal to 14 in base-10. We write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 5 + 1. This gives us 8 in base-9. We write down the 8 and there is no carry-over this time.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (81s place): 4 + 8. This gives us 12 in base-9, which is equal to 13 in base-10. We write down the 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, we write down the carry-over 1 in the next place (729s place).\n\nSo, the sum of 426 and 857 in base-9 is \\boxed{1384}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6 and 4). In base-9, 6+4=12, which is equal to 1 in the next column and 2 in the current column. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (0 and 5) and the carry-over (1).

So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 4: Since there is a carry-over, we write down the 1 in the next column.\n\nThe final result is 1262.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (5 and 3). In base-9, 5+3=8. So, we write down 8 as the rightmost digit of the sum.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (7 and 4). In base-9, 7+4=11. Since 11 is greater than 8, we need to carry over. In base-9, 11 is represented as 12 (1*9^1 + 2*9^0). So, we write down 2 as the middle digit of the sum and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (3 and 2) and the carry-over (1). In base-9, 3+2+1=6. So, we write down 6 as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 375+243=\\boxed{628} in base-9.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

We don't need to carry over anything this time.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (81s place): 1 + 8 = 9. However, since we are in base-9, we can't have a digit of 9. So, 9 in base-10 is equal to 10 in base-9 (since 9 in base-10 is 1 * 9^1 + 0 * 9^0). We write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there is a carry-over from the leftmost column, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final result is 1 (carry-over) followed by the other digits we found: 1, 0, and 4.\n\nTherefore, 155 + 828 in base-9 is equal to \\boxed{1040}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (3 + 8).\nSince 3 + 8 = 11, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 2 (11 - 9) and carry over 1.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (5 + 3) and the carry-over from the previous step (1).\n5 + 3 + 1 = 9, which is equal to the base. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (6 + 5) and the carry-over from the previous step (1).\n6 + 5 + 1 = 12, which is greater than 8. We need to carry over 1 again. So, we write down 3 (12 - 9) and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over 1 as the leftmost digit of the result.\n\nSo, 653 + 538 in base-9 is \\boxed{1302}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (ones place): 8 + 5. Since 8 + 5 = 13, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over. In base-9, 13 is represented as 14 (since 13 in base-10 is 1 set of 9 and 4 left over). So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (nines place) along with the carry-over: 7 + 5 + 1. Since 7 + 5 + 1 = 13, which is again greater than 8, we need to carry over. In base-9, 13 is represented as 14. So, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (81s place) along with the carry-over: 1 + 1 + 1. Since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is less than 8, we don't need to carry over. We simply write down the 3.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 178 + 155 = \\boxed{344}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since 1 + 8 + 2 = 11 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 in the ten's place.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (hundred's place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 2 + 8. Since 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 in the hundred's place.\n\nSo, the result of 283 + 827 in base-9 is \\boxed{2200}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (7 and 0)\n7 + 0 = 7\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (6 and 3)\n6 + 3 = 11 (which is 12 in base-9)\n\nSince 11 is a two-digit number, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (8 and 2) and the carry-over (1)\n8 + 2 + 1 = 11 (which is 12 in base-9)\n\nSo, the result is 12,17 in base-9 notation. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1217}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (4 and 5).\n4 + 5 = 9. Since we are in base-9, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 0.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (6 and 8) and the carry-over (1).\n6 + 8 + 1 = 15. In base-9, this is represented as 16 (since 15 in base-10 is 1 set of 9 and 6 left over). So, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 6.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (6 and 6) and the carry-over (1).\n6 + 6 + 1 = 13. In base-9, this is represented as 14 (since 13 in base-10 is 1 set of 9 and 4 left over). So, we write down 14.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 14, 6, and 0. The result is \\boxed{1460}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 352+251? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + 1 = 3 (ones place)\n\n5 + 5 = 12 (tens place, but since we are in base-9, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 2)\n\n3 + 2 + 1 (carried over) = 6 (hundreds place)\n\nSo, the result is 623.\n\nTherefore, 352 + 251 in base-9 is \\boxed{623}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6 and 2).\n6 + 2 = 8\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (5 and 5).\n5 + 5 = 10. Since we are in base-9, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value and write down 0.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (5 and 2) and the carry-over from the previous step (1).\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 808\n\nSo, 556 + 252 in base-9 is \\boxed{808}.
