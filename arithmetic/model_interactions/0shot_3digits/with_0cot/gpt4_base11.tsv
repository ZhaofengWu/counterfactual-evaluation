Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 9 (from 499) + 1 (from 261) = 10 in base-11, which is A. We write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. Middle column: 9 (from 499) + 6 (from 261) + 1 (carried over) = 16 in base-11, which is 15 in base-10. Since 15 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-11, we write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. Leftmost column: 4 (from 499) + 2 (from 261) + 1 (carried over) = 7 in base-11.\n\nNow, we combine the digits we got from each column: 7, 4, and A. So, 499 + 261 in base-11 is \\boxed{74A}.

Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 7 + 10 = 17 in base-10. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16, so we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the next column, including the carry-over: 1 + 3 + 4. In base-10, this is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. Since 8 is the same in both base-10 and base-11, we write down the 8.\n\nSo, the result of 317 + 40A in base-11 is \\boxed{86A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, "A" represents the number 10. So, we can rewrite A14 as:\n\nA14 = 10 \xd7 11\xb2 + 1 \xd7 11\xb9 + 4 \xd7 11\u2070\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n186 = 1 \xd7 121 + 8 \xd7 11 + 6 \xd7 1 = 121 + 88 + 6 = 215\nA14 = 10 \xd7 121 + 1 \xd7 11 + 4 \xd7 1 = 1210 + 11 + 4 = 1225\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers:\n\n215 + 1225 = 1440\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 1440 and determine how many times it can fit into the number:\n\n11\xb3 = 1331 (which is less than 1440)\n\nNow, we'll divide 1440 by 1331:\n\n1440 \xf7 1331 = 1 (with a remainder of 109)\n\nSo, the coefficient for the 11\xb3 place value is 1. Now, let's find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to the remainder (109):\n\n11\xb2 = 121 (which is less than 109)\n\nNow, we'll divide 109 by 121:\n\n109 \xf7 121 = 0 (with a remainder of 109)\n\nSo, the coefficient for the 11\xb2 place value is 0. Now, let's find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to the remainder (109):\n\n11\xb9 = 11 (which is less than 109)\n\nNow, we'll divide 109 by 11:\n\n109 \xf7 11 = 9 (with a remainder of 10)\n\nSo, the coefficient for the 11\xb9 place value is 9. Finally, the remainder is 10, which is equal to "A" in base-11. So, the coefficient for the 11\u2070 place value is A.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n1 \xd7 11\xb3 + 0 \xd7 11\xb2 + 9 \xd7 11\xb9 + A \xd7 11\u2070 = 1 \xd7 1331 + 0 \xd7 121 + 9 \xd7 11 + 10 \xd7 1 = 1331 + 0 + 99 + 10 = 1440\n\nSo, the sum of 186 and A14 in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{109A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 8 + 9. Since we are in base-11, we know that 10 is represented by "A". So, 8 + 9 = 17 in base-10, which is equal to 1A in base-11. We write down the "A" and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (11s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 0 + 0 = 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (121s place): 3 + 8 = 11 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-11. We write down the "1" and carry over the "0".\n\nPutting it all together, we have 1 in the 121s place, 1 in the 11s place, and A in the units place. So, 308 + 809 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{11A}.

So, we have:\n\nA2A = (10 \xd7 11^2) + (2 \xd7 11^1) + (10 \xd7 11^0) = (10 \xd7 121) + (2 \xd7 11) + (10 \xd7 1) = 1210 + 22 + 10 = 1242\n\n40A = (4 \xd7 11^2) + (0 \xd7 11^1) + (10 \xd7 11^0) = (4 \xd7 121) + (0 \xd7 11) + (10 \xd7 1) = 484 + 0 + 10 = 494\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers:\n\n1242 + 494 = 1736\n\nNow, let's convert the result back to base-11:\n\n1736 \xf7 11^2 = 1736 \xf7 121 \u2248 14 R 30\n14 \xf7 11^1 = 14 \xf7 11 \u2248 1 R 3\n30 \xf7 11^0 = 30 \xf7 1 = 30\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 1A30.\n\n\\boxed{1A30}.

To add A7A and 307 in base-11, we'll start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: A + 7.\nSince A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 7 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16 (1 * 11^1) + 6 (6 * 11^0), so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits: 7 + 0, and don't forget to add the carry-over 1.\n7 + 0 + 1 = 8, so we write down 8.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: A + 3.\nAgain, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 3 = 13.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost digit: 3 + 5 = 8 (no carrying needed)\n2. Middle digit: 1 + 6 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n3.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n2 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 2 + 10 (in base-10), which is 12 (in base-10). Since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 2. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 2.\n\nNext, let's add the middle column digits along with the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 + 7 = 10 (in base-10). Since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 0. So, the middle digit of the sum is 0.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost column digits along with the carry-over from the previous step:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 1 + 9 + 10 (in base-10), which is 20 (in base-10). Since we are working in base-11, we need to write down 20 as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0).\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 1A02 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1A02}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A6A and 787 in base-11, we'll start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: A + 7.\n   A in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 7 = 17.\n   Since 17 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column.\n   The rightmost digit of the sum is 7 (17 - 1 * 11).\n\n2. Add the middle digits: 6 + 8 + 1 (carry-over).\n   6 + 8 + 1 = 15.\n   Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column.\n   The middle digit of the sum is 4 (15 - 1 * 11).\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: A + 7 + 1 (carry-over).\n   10 + 7 + 1 = 18.\n   Since 18 is less than 22 (2 * 11), we don't need to carry over.\n   The leftmost digit of the sum is 18.\n\nSo, the sum of A6A and 787 in base-11 is 1847.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1847}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + 9 = 16. Since we are in base-11, we carry over the 1 and write down 6.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n6 + 8 + 1 (carried over) = 15. Again, since we are in base-11, we carry over the 1 and write down 5.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit.\n\n6 + 4 + 1 (carried over) = 11. In base-11, this is represented as 10. So, we write down 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nSince there is nothing left to add, we write down the carried over 1.\n\nSo, 677 + 489 in base-11 is \\boxed{1566}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n0 + 0 = 0\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n5 + 5 = A (since 10 in base-11 is represented by A)\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit.\n\n4 + 6 = A (since 10 in base-11 is represented by A)\n\nSo, the sum of 405 and 650 in base-11 is A0A.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{A0A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 4 + 6 = 10. Since we are in base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the second column, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 2 + 2 = 5. We write down "5" and don't need to carry over anything to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 9 + A. In base-11, "A" represents the number 10. So, 9 + 10 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to an additional column on the left. 19 - 11 = 8, so we write down "8" in the leftmost column.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 1 (carry-over) + 8 + 5 + A = \\boxed{185A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A47 and 218 in base-11, we'll start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 7 + 8. In base-10, this is 15. Since 15 in base-11 is represented as 14 (1*11^1 + 4*11^0), we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Add the next digits, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 4 + 1. In base-10, this is 6. We write down the 6.\n\n3. Add the next digits: A + 2. In base-10, this is 10 + 2 = 12. Since 12 in base-11 is represented as 10 (1*11^1 + 0*11^0), we write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\n4. Since there are no more digits in the second number, we just bring down the carry-over and the remaining digit from the first number: 1 (carry-over) + 1. In base-10, this is 2. We write down the 2.\n\nSo, A47 + 218 in base-11 is 2064. The result is \\boxed{2064}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 just like we would in base-10, but carrying over when the sum is greater than or equal to 11.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n5 + A (which is 10 in base-10) = 15 in base-10. Since 15 is greater than or equal to 11, we carry over 1 and write down 4 (15 - 11) as the rightmost digit.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit:\n1 (carried over) + 7 + 3 = 11 in base-10. Since 11 is equal to 11, we carry over 1 and write down 0 as the next digit.\n\nFinally, we have:\n1 (carried over) + 1 + 2 = 4 in base-10, which is also 4 in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum is 175 + 32A = 4014 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{4014}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n8 + 8 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 5 + 8 = 14 in base-10. Since 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 8 + 7 = 16 in base-10. Since 16 in base-10 is equal to 15 in base-11, we write down 5.\n\nSo, the sum of 858 and 788 in base-11 is \\boxed{53A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Rightmost column: 1 + 1 = 2.\n2. Middle column: 9 + 9 = 18 in base-10, which is 16 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0 = 11 + 6 = 18). So, we write down 6 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n3. Leftmost column: 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 9 = 11 in base-10, which is 10 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 11).\n\nPutting the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{1062}.

Adding the units place: 4 + 6 = 10. Since we are in base-11, 10 is represented by the letter "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\n2. Adding the tens place: 3 + 9 = 12. Now, add the carry-over from the previous step: 12 + 1 = 13. In base-11, 13 is represented as "12" (1*11^1 + 2*11^0). So, we write down "2" and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\n3. Adding the hundreds place: 7 + 9 = 16. Now, add the carry-over from the previous step: 16 + 1 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented as "15" (1*11^1 + 5*11^0). So, we write down "15".\n\nNow, putting all the digits together, we get the result: 15A.\n\nSo, 734 + 996 in base-11 is \\boxed{15A}.

Rightmost column: 9 + 0 = 9\n2. Middle column: 6 + 3 = 9\n3. Leftmost column: 8 + A\n\nNow, we need to convert A to its decimal equivalent. In base-11, A represents 10. So, we have:\n\n8 + 10 = 18\n\nSince 18 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n0 + 2 = 2\n\n6 + A (which is 10 in base-11) = 16 in base-10. Since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the extra value. 16 in base-10 is equal to 15 in base-11 (1*11^1 + 5*11^0).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 2 + 10 (in base-10), which is 12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 2.\n\nNow, let's move to the next place value.\n\n8 + 7 + 1 (the carry-over) is equivalent to 8 + 7 + 1 (in base-10), which is 16. Since 16 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the middle digit of the sum is 6.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost place value.\n\n6 + 6 + 1 (the carry-over) is equivalent to 6 + 6 + 1 (in base-10), which is 13. Since 13 is greater than 10, we need to represent it using two digits. So, the leftmost digits of the sum are 13, which is written as 13 in base-11.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 682 + 67A = 1362 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1362}.

In base-11, 15 is represented as 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we have 1 (from the carry over) = 1.\n\nSo, the result is 1401 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{1401}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 7 + 6. In base-10, this would be 13. However, in base-11, we represent 10 as A and 11 as 10. So, 13 in base-11 is 1A. We write down the A and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 2 + 8 + 1. In base-10, this would be 11. In base-11, we represent 11 as 10. So, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + A + 4. In base-10, A is 10, so this would be 1 + 10 + 4 = 15. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14 (since 11 is 10, 12 is 11, 13 is 12, 14 is 13, and 15 is 14).\n\nSo, the final result is 14A. Therefore, the sum of 2A7 and 486 in base-11 is \\boxed{14A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (4 + 8).\nIn base-11, 4 + 8 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (3 + 8) and the carry-over (1).\nIn base-11, 3 + 8 = 11, and 11 + 1 = 12. Again, since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (4 + 1) and the carry-over (1).\nIn base-11, 4 + 1 = 5, and 5 + 1 = 6.

First, let's break down the numbers into their place values in base-11:\n\n39A = 3 * 11^2 + 9 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0\n921 = 9 * 11^2 + 2 * 11^1 + 1 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n39A = 3 * 121 + 9 * 11 + 10\n    = 363 + 99 + 10\n    = 472\n\n921 = 9 * 121 + 2 * 11 + 1\n    = 1089 + 22 + 1\n    = 1112\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers:\n\n472 + 1112 = 1584\n\nNow, we need to convert this number back to base-11. Let's find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 1584:\n\n11^3 = 1331 (too large)\n11^2 = 121 (too small)\n\nSo, the largest power of 11 is 11^2 = 121. Now, let's find out how many times 121 fits into 1584:\n\n1584 \xf7 121 \u2248 13 (with a remainder)\n\nSo, we have 13 * 11^2. Now, let's find the remainder:\n\n1584 - 13 * 121 = 1584 - 1573 = 11\n\nNow, we need to find how many times 11^1 (11) fits into the remainder:\n\n11 \xf7 11 = 1 (with no remainder)\n\nSo, we have 1 * 11^1. Since there is no remainder, we don't need to add any more terms.\n\nNow, let's write the final result in base-11:\n\n\\boxed{1310}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 (no carrying needed)\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n3 + 0 = 3 (no carrying needed)\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit.\n\n6 + 4 = A (since A represents 10 in base-11)\n\nSo, the sum of 632 and 402 in base-11 is A34.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{A34}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 1 + 1 = 2.\n2. Middle column: 2 + 9 = B (since 11 in base-11 is represented by A, 11+1 = B).\n3. Leftmost column: 9 + 7 = 10, which is A in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum of 921 and 791 in base-11 is AB2.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{AB2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is AA7+399? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 7 + 9. In base-11, 7 + 9 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (tens place) along with the carry-over: A + 9 + 1. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 9 + 1 = 20. Since 20 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (hundreds place) along with the carry-over: A + 3 + 1. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is less than 11^2 (which is 121), we don't need to carry over any more digits.\n\nSo, the final result is 1406 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1406}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n5 + A: Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, 5 + A = 5 + 10 = 15. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14 (1 * 11^1 + 4 * 11^0). So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the next digits, including the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 4 + 7 = 1 + 4 + 7 = 12. In base-11, 12 is represented as 10 (1 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0). So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we add the carry-over to the next place value:\n\n1 (carry-over) = 1.\n\nSo, the result is 104 in base-11. Therefore, the sum is \\boxed{104}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 just like we would in base-10, but carrying over when we reach 11.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n1 + A (which is 10 in base-10) = 11 in base-10. Since we reached 11, we carry over 1 and write down 0 as the rightmost digit.\n\nNow, moving to the next digit:\n1 (carry-over) + 7 + 6 = 14 in base-10. Since 14 is greater than 11, we carry over 1 and write down 3 as the next digit.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit:\n1 (carry-over) + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, the result is 230 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{230}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n3 + 2 = 5 (no carrying needed)\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n7 + 5 = C (since 7 + 5 = 12 in base-10, and 12 in base-11 is represented by the digit C)\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit.\n\n3 + 9 = A + 2 (since 3 + 9 = 12 in base-10, and 12 in base-11 is represented by A + 1)\n\nSo, 373 + 952 in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{AC5}.

Units place: 4 + 0 = 4\n2. Tens place: 5 + 6 = B (since 11 in base-11 is represented by A, 5+6=11, which is B in base-11)\n3. Hundreds place: 7 + 8 = 10 (in base-10), which is equal to A in base-11.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: AB4\n\nSo, 754 + 860 in base-11 is \\boxed{AB4}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Units place: 4 + 0 = 4\n2. Tens place: 8 + 7 = 15. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and keep 5 in the tens place. So, 15 in base-11 is represented as 1A (1*11^1 + A*11^0).\n3. Hundreds place: 5 + 9 = 14. Now, add the carry-over from the previous step: 14 + 1 = 15. Again, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value and keep 5 in the hundreds place. So, 15 in base-11 is represented as 1A (1*11^1 + A*11^0).\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 554 in base-11.\n\nSo, 584 + 970 in base-11 is \\boxed{554}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's break down the numbers into their place values:\n\n998 = 9 * 11^2 + 9 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0\n5A0 = 5 * 11^2 + 10 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's add the numbers:\n\n(9 * 11^2 + 9 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0) + (5 * 11^2 + 10 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0)\n\nNow, let's combine the like terms:\n\n(9 * 11^2 + 5 * 11^2) + (9 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^1) + (8 * 11^0 + 0 * 11^0)\n\nNow, let's simplify:\n\n14 * 11^2 + 19 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0\n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to carry over when a digit is greater than or equal to 11. In this case, the 19 * 11^1 term needs to be carried over:\n\n14 * 11^2 + 1 * 11^3 + 8 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's rewrite the number in base-11 notation:\n\n\\boxed{1488}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add A4A and 488 in base-11, we'll start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: A (which is 10 in base-10) + 8. In base-10, this is 10 + 8 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 11, we need to carry over. 18 in base-11 is 16, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits: 4 + 8 + the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 4 + 8 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 11, we need to carry over. 13 in base-11 is 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits: A (which is 10 in base-10) + 4 + the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 10 + 4 + 1 = 15. 15 in base-11 is 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n4.

In base-11, 3 + 9 = 12, and 12 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 10, we carry over the 1 and write down the 3. So, the second digit of the sum is 3.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column: 6 + A + 1 (the carry-over). In base-11, A is equal to 10. So, 6 + 10 = 16, and 16 + 1 = 17. Since 17 is less than 100, we don't need to carry over any more digits. So, the leftmost digits of the sum are 17.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 639 + 9A5 = 1734 in base-11.

In base-11, A represents 10, so 9 + A = 9 + 10 = 19. Since 19 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. So, we write down 8 (19 - 11) and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 3 + 9 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over again. So, we write down 2 (13 - 11) and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1 in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, 391 + 9A8 in base-11 is \\boxed{1289}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down a 7 in the rightmost column of the result.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column: 8 + 6. In base-11, 8 + 6 = 14. Since 14 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. 14 in base-11 is represented as 13 (1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0). So, we write down a 3 in the middle column of the result and carry over the 1 to the leftmost column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 + 1 + A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, 1 + 1 + 10 = 12. Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. 12 in base-11 is represented as 11 (1 * 11^1 + 1 * 11^0).

Rightmost digit: 8 + 9 = 17 (in base-10). Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 7. So, we have 7 in the rightmost digit.\n\n2. Middle digit: 0 + A (which is 10 in base-10) + 1 (carried over from the previous step) = 11 (in base-10). Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 0. So, we have 0 in the middle digit.\n\n3. Leftmost digit: 8 + 7 + 1 (carried over from the previous step) = 16 (in base-10). In base-11, this is represented as 15 (since 16 in base-10 is equal to 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0).\n\nSo, the result is 1507 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1507}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nA (in base-11) + 5 = 10 (in base-11) + 5 = 15 (in base-10). Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 4 (15 - 11 = 4).\n\nNow, let's move to the next place value.\n\n1 (carried over) + 9 + 0 = 1 + 9 = 10 (in base-10). Since 10 is equal to 11 in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the middle digit of the sum is 0 (10 - 11 = -1, but since we can't have negative digits, we use 0 and carry over 1).\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost place value.\n\n1 (carried over) + 4 + 2 = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7 (in base-10).\n\nSo, the sum of 405 and 92A in base-11 is 704.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{704}.

Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down 3.\n\nSo, A34 + 361 in base-11 is equal to 1(11^2) + 3(11^1) + 5(11^0) = 121 + 33 + 5 = 159 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 159 back to base-11: \n\n159 \xf7 11 = 14 R5, so we write down 5.\n\n14 \xf7 11 = 1 R3, so we write down 3.\n\n1 \xf7 11 = 0 R1, so we write down 1.\n\nThus, A34 + 361 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{135}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nA (in base-11) + 2 (in base-11) = 10 (in base-11) + 2 (in base-11) = 12 (in base-11). Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carried over) + 9 (in base-11) + 3 (in base-11) = 1 (in base-11) + 9 (in base-11) + 3 (in base-11) = 13 (in base-11). Since 13 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n1 (carried over) + 7 (in base-11) + 6 (in base-11) = 1 (in base-11) + 7 (in base-11) + 6 (in base-11) = 14 (in base-11). Since 14 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more columns, we just write down the carried over 1 at the beginning.\n\nSo, the result is 1,432 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the sum of 79A and 632 in base-11 is \\boxed{1432}.

So, we write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n6 + 9 = 15 in base-10. Since we carried over 1 from the previous column, we need to add that as well: 15 + 1 = 16 in base-10. To convert this to base-11, we have 16 - 5 = 11, which is equal to 10 in base-11. So, we write down 10.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n  683\n+ 961\n------\n  1034\n\nSo, 683 + 961 in base-11 is \\boxed{1034}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Rightmost digit: 7 + 6 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Middle digit: 3 + 3 = 6, and add the carry-over 1, we get 7 in base-10, which is also 7 in base-11. So, we write down 7.\n\n3. Leftmost digit: 7 + 7 = 14 in base-10, which is equal to 13 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0 = 14). So, we write down 13.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 13, 7, and 2.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the middle column: A (which is 10 in base-10) + 9. In base-10, this would be 19, but we need to convert it to base-11. To do this, we divide 19 by 11, which gives us 1 with a remainder of 8.

Leftmost column: A + 5 + 1 (carried over) = A + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remainder, which is 5. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 5.\n\nNow, let's move to the middle column: A + 2, plus the 1 we carried over. In base-10, A is equal to 10, so we have 10 + 2 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remainder, which is 2. So, the middle digit of the sum is 2.\n\nFinally, let's add the leftmost column: 5 + 4, plus the 1 we carried over. In base-10, this would be 5 + 4 + 1 = 10. Since 10 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over any digits, and the leftmost digit of the sum is A.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 5A7 + 428 = \\boxed{A25}.

First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n8 + A: Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, 8 + A = 8 + 10 = 18 in base-10.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  71A\n+ A65\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have A + 5. In base-11, A represents 10, so 10 + 5 = 15. Since 15 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. 15 in base-11 is represented as 14 (1 * 11^1 + 4 * 11^0), so we write down the 4 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n   1\n  71A\n+ A65\n-----\n    4\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.

Since 17 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. 17 in base-11 is represented as 16 (1 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0), so we write down the 6 and carry over the 1:\n\n```\n  1\n  71A\n+ A65\n-----\n 684\n```\n\nSo, 71A + A65 in base-11 is \\boxed{684}.

First, let's add the numbers in base-11 just like we would in base-10, but carrying over when the sum is greater than or equal to 11.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 8 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 8 + 10 = 18.

We have 4 + 8, plus the carry-over 1, which gives us 4 + 8 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 11, we carry over 1 and write down the remainder, which is 13 - 11 = 2.\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit.

First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: A (in base-11) + 2 = 10 (in base-11) + 2 = 12 (in base-11). Since 12 is greater than the base (11), we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 as the rightmost digit of the result.\n\nStep 2: Now, we add the carried-over 1, 5 (from 55A), and 9 (from 892). So, 1 + 5 + 9 = 15 (in base-11). Again, 15 is greater than the base (11), so we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 5 as the next digit of the result.\n\nStep 3: Finally, we add the carried-over 1, 5 (from 55A), and 8 (from 892). So, 1 + 5 + 8 = 14 (in base-11). Since 14 is greater than the base (11), we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 as the next digit of the result.\n\nStep 4: We have a carried-over 1, which becomes the leftmost digit of the result.\n\nSo, the result of 55A (in base-11) + 892 (in base-11) is 1452 (in base-11).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1452}.

In base-11, this is represented as 10, so we need to carry over the 1 to the next column and keep the 0 in the hundreds place.\n\nSince there is a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left of the hundreds place.

To add the numbers A7A and A39 in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have A + 9. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 8 in the rightmost column.\n\n2. In the middle column, we have 7 + 3 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). So, 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. Since 11 is equal to the base, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the middle column.\n\n3. In the leftmost column, we have A + A + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 10 + 1 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 11, we'll write down 1 and carry over 1 to the next column. Since there are no more columns, we'll just write down the carry-over as a new leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the sum of A7A and A39 in base-11 is 1208.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1208}.

First, let's break down the numbers 47A and A3A into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n47A in base-11 means 4 * 11^2 + 7 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 4 * 121 + 7 * 11 + 10 = 484 + 77 + 10 = 571 in base-10.\n\nA3A in base-11 means 10 * 11^2 + 3 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 10 * 121 + 3 * 11 + 10 = 1210 + 33 + 10 = 1253 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the base-10 equivalents: 571 + 1253 = 1824.\n\nNow, we need to convert 1824 back to base-11. \n\n1824 / 11^2 = 1824 / 121 \u2248 15 with a remainder of 49. So, we have 1 * 11^2.\n\n49 / 11^1 = 49 / 11 = 4 with a remainder of 5.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Units place: 6 + 4 = 10. Since we are in base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\n2. Tens place: 3 + 5 + 1 (carry-over) = 9. We write down "9" and there is no carry-over.\n\n3. Hundreds place: 1 + A. In base-11, "A" represents the value 10. So, 1 + 10 = 11. Since we are in base-11, 11 is represented by "10". So, we write down "0" and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\n4. Thousands place: There is only the carry-over 1, so we write down "1".\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{109A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 3 + 9. In base-11, this would be:\n\n3 + 9 = 12, which is equal to 10 + 2. Since 12 is greater than the base-11, we carry over the 1 and write down the 2.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over: 0 + A + 1. In base-11, A represents 10, so this would be:\n\n0 + 10 + 1 = 11, which is equal to the base-11. So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 0.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 2 + 2 + 1. In base-11, this would be:\n\n2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nNow, let's put the results together: 5 in the leftmost column, 0 in the middle column, and 2 in the rightmost column. So, the sum is:\n\n\\boxed{502}.

In base-11, this would be:\n\n4 + 6 = 10 (in base-10)\n\nSince 10 in base-10 is equal to A in base-11, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 7 + 6 + 1. In base-11, this would be:\n\n7 + 6 + 1 = 14 (in base-10)\n\nSince 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, we write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (from A74) + 4 + 1 (carry-over). In base-11, this would be:\n\n1 + 4 + 1 = 6 (in base-10)\n\nSince 6 in base-10 is equal to 6 in base-11, we write down 6.\n\nSo, A74 + 466 in base-11 is equal to 63A in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{63A}.

We write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 + 9 = 12 in base-11. We write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + A (which is 10 in base-11) = 12 in base-11.

Rightmost digit (ones place): 7 + 6 = 13. Since we are in base-11, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 3. So far, we have "3".\n\n2. Middle digit (elevens place): 8 + 5 + 1 (carried over) = 14. Again, since we are in base-11, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 4. Now we have "43".\n\n3. Leftmost digit (hundreds place): 2 + 7 + 1 (carried over) = 10. In base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A".

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2nd digit (1's place): 6 + 2 = 8\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n1st digit (11's place): 1 + A\n\nSince we are in base-11, we need to remember that A represents 10 in base-10. So, 1 + 10 = 11. However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 to the next place value and write down 0 in the current place value.\n\nSo, the 1st digit is 0, and we carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n0th digit (121's place): 1 (carried over) + 1 = 2\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 208\n\nSo, 116 + AA2 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{208}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier.\n\n80A in base-11 means 8 * 11^2 + 0 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 8 * 121 + 0 * 11 + 10 = 968 + 10 = 978.\n\n552 in base-11 means 5 * 11^2 + 5 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 5 * 121 + 5 * 11 + 2 = 605 + 55 + 2 = 662.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 978 + 662 = 1640.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 1640 by 11 and find the remainder: 1640 \xf7 11 = 149 with a remainder of 1. So, the rightmost digit in base-11 is 1.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (149) by 11 and find the remainder: 149 \xf7 11 = 13 with a remainder of 6. So, the next digit to the left in base-11 is 6.\n\n3. Divide the quotient (13) by 11 and find the remainder: 13 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 2. So, the next digit to the left in base-11 is 2.\n\n4. Since the quotient (1) is less than 11, it becomes the leftmost digit in base-11. So, the leftmost digit is 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result in base-11: 1261.\n\nSo, 80A + 552 in base-11 is \\boxed{1261}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost digit (1s place): 4 + 5 = 9\n2. Middle digit (11s place): A + A = 10 + 10 = 20. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra value. 20 in base-11 is 1*11^1 + 9*11^0, so we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n3.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 4 + 6 = 10. Since we are in base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3. We write down "3" and there is no carry-over to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 9 + A. In base-11, "A" represents the number 10. So, 9 + 10 = 19. Since we are in base-11, we need to represent 19 as a two-digit number. To do this, we divide 19 by 11 and find that it is equal to 1 remainder 8. So, we write down "18" as the leftmost digits.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{183A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nUnits place: 9 + 5 = 14 (in base-10). Since 14 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the units place digit is 4.\n\nTens place: 4 + 4 + 1 (carry-over) = 9 (in base-10). There is no need to carry over, so the tens place digit is 9.\n\nHundreds place: 7 + 4 = 11 (in base-10). Since 11 is equal to 10 in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the hundreds place digit is 0, and we have a new digit in the thousands place.\n\nThousands place: 1 (carry-over) = 1.\n\nSo, the result is 1,094 in base-11.

In base-10, this would be 11, but in base-11, this is represented as A.\n\nSo, the sum of 283 and 844 in base-11 is A17.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{A17}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n4 + 7 = 11 (in base-10), which is 10 in base-11.

To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 1793 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   1793 \xf7 11 = 163, remainder 0.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (163) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder.\n   163 \xf7 11 = 14, remainder 9.\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (14) by 11 and find the final quotient and remainder.\n   14 \xf7 11 = 1, remainder 3.\n\n4. The final quotient is 1, which is less than 11, so we stop here.\n\nNow, we'll write the remainders in reverse order to get the result in base-11: 1390.\n\nSo, A30 + 460 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1390} in base-11.

First, let's convert the numbers A17 and 256 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA17 in base-11 means (10 * 11^1) + (1 * 11^0) = 110 + 1 = 111 in base-10.\n\n256 in base-11 means (2 * 11^2) + (5 * 11^1) + (6 * 11^0) = 242 + 55 + 6 = 303 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 111 + 303 = 414.\n\nFinally, let's convert the result back to base-11:\n\n414 \xf7 11^2 = 414 \xf7 121 \u2248 3 (remainder 69)\n69 \xf7 11^1 = 69 \xf7 11 = 6 (remainder 3)\n3 \xf7 11^0 = 3 \xf7 1 = 3\n\nSo, the result is 363 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{363}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers A38 and 188 into their place values in base-11.\n\nA38:\n- A (10 in base-10) is in the 11^2 place: 10 * 11^2 = 10 * 121 = 1210\n- 3 is in the 11^1 place: 3 * 11^1 = 3 * 11 = 33\n- 8 is in the 11^0 place: 8 * 11^0 = 8 * 1 = 8\n\nSo, A38 in base-10 is 1210 + 33 + 8 = 1251.\n\n188:\n- 1 is in the 11^2 place: 1 * 11^2 = 1 * 121 = 121\n- 8 is in the 11^1 place: 8 * 11^1 = 8 * 11 = 88\n- 8 is in the 11^0 place: 8 * 11^0 = 8 * 1 = 8\n\nSo, 188 in base-10 is 121 + 88 + 8 = 217.\n\nNow, let's add the base-10 representations of the numbers: 1251 + 217 = 1468.\n\nFinally, let's convert the sum back to base-11:\n\n1468 \xf7 11^2 = 1468 \xf7 121 \u2248 12, remainder 16\n12 \xf7 11^1 = 12 \xf7 11 \u2248 1, remainder 1\n1 \xf7 11^0 = 1 \xf7 1 = 1\n\nSo, the sum in base-11 is 1211.\n\nThus, A38 + 188 in base-11 is \\boxed{1211}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 9 + 5. Since we are in base-11, we have:\n\n9 + 5 = 14 (in base-10)\n\nHowever, we need to convert this back to base-11. 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, which can be written as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we write down A and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (11s place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 2 + 0. This gives us:\n\n1 + 2 + 0 = 3 (in base-11)\n\nSince there are no more columns to add, our final result is 3A in base-11. Therefore, the sum of 209 and 605 in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{3A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 4 + 6. In base-10, this would be 10, but in base-11, it is written as "10" which is equal to "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (11s place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 7 + 1. In base-10, this would be 13, but in base-11, it is written as "12" which is equal to "1A". So, we write down "A" and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (121s place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 8 + 1. In base-10, this would be 12, but in base-11, it is written as "11" which is equal to "10". So, we write down "1" and carry over the "0" (which doesn't affect the result).\n\nPutting it all together, we get the result: \\boxed{1AA}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n3 + A (which is 10 in base-11) = 13 in base-11. We write down the 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, including the carry-over.\n\n1 (carry-over) + A (which is 10 in base-11) + 5 = 16 in base-11. We write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost place value, including the carry-over.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 = 2 in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum of 1A3 and 85A in base-11 is 263.\n\n\\boxed{263}.

In base-11, 9 + 1 = A and 9 + 2 = 10. So, 0 + 9 = 9.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 3 + A. Since A represents 10 in base-11, 3 + 10 = 13. In base-11, 13 can be represented as 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0, which is equal to 12.\n\nSo, the sum of 307 and 9A2 in base-11 is 1299.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1299}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the given expression: 74A + A73.\n\n74A in base-11 means 7 * 11^2 + 4 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 7 * 121 + 4 * 11 + 10 = 847 + 44 + 10 = 901.\n\nA73 in base-11 means 10 * 11^2 + 7 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0 = 10 * 121 + 7 * 11 + 3 = 1210 + 77 + 3 = 1290.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers: 901 + 1290 = 2191.\n\nTo express 2191 in base-11, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 2191. In this case, it is 11^2 = 121.\n\nNow, let's find out how many times 121 can fit into 2191: 2191 \xf7 121 \u2248 18.1. Since we are working with base-11, we can only use the digits 0-10 (A), so we will use 18 (1A in base-11) as the coefficient for 11^2.\n\nNext, we need to find the remainder: 2191 - 18 * 121 = 2191 - 2178 = 13.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 13. In this case, it is 11^1 = 11.\n\nNow, let's find out how many times 11 can fit into 13: 13 \xf7 11 \u2248 1.18. Since we are working with base-11, we can only use the digits 0-10 (A), so we will use 1 as the coefficient for 11^1.\n\nFinally, we need to find the remainder: 13 - 1 * 11 = 13 - 11 = 2.\n\nSo, the final expression in base-11 is 1A12.\n\nTherefore, 74A + A73 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A12}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers into their place values in base-11:\n\n179 = 1 * 11^2 + 7 * 11^1 + 9 * 11^0\nAA2 = A * 11^2 + A * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's convert the "A" digit to its decimal equivalent, which is 10:\n\nAA2 = 10 * 11^2 + 10 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n179 = 1 * 121 + 7 * 11 + 9 * 1 = 121 + 77 + 9 = 207\nAA2 = 10 * 121 + 10 * 11 + 2 * 1 = 1210 + 110 + 2 = 1322\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers:\n\n207 + 1322 = 1529\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 1529 and work our way down:\n\n11^3 = 1331 (too large)\n11^2 = 121 (fits)\n\nNow, we'll divide 1529 by 121:\n\n1529 \xf7 121 = 12 with a remainder of 97.\n\nSince 12 is greater than the largest digit in base-11 (which is A or 10), we need to carry over:\n\n12 in base-11 is 10 + 2, so we have 1 in the 11^3 place and 2 in the 11^2 place.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n1 * 11^3 + 2 * 11^2 + remainder\n\nThe remainder is 97, and we'll continue converting to base-11:\n\n97 \xf7 11 = 8 with a remainder of 9.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1 * 11^3 + 2 * 11^2 + 8 * 11^1 + 9 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's write the result in base-11 notation:\n\n\\boxed{1289}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A75 and A56 in base-11, we'll perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 5 + 6. In base-10, this is 11, which is equal to 10 in base-11. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\n2. Add the middle digits along with the carry-over: 7 + 5 + 1. In base-10, this is 13, which is equal to 12 in base-11. So, we write down a 2 and carry over a 1.\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: A + A + 1. In base-10, this is 10 + 10 + 1 = 21, which is equal to 1A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over a 1.\n\n4. Since we have a carry-over, we need to add an extra digit: 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the base-11 numbers to base-10 to make the addition easier.\n\nAA2 in base-11 means (10 * 11^2) + (10 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 1331 + 110 + 2 = 1443 in base-10.\n\n966 in base-11 means (9 * 11^2) + (6 * 11^1) + (6 * 11^0) = 1089 + 66 + 6 = 1161 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers: 1443 + 1161 = 2604.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 2604 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 2604 \xf7 11 = 236 with a remainder of 8. So, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 8.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (236) by 11: 236 \xf7 11 = 21 with a remainder of 5. So, the next digit to the left is 5.\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (21) by 11: 21 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 10. Since 10 is represented by "A" in base-11, the next digit to the left is A.\n\n4. The last quotient (1) is less than 11, so it becomes the leftmost digit.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the base-11 number 1A58.\n\nSo, AA2 + 966 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1A58}.

Since 15 is greater than the base, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + 8 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, including the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 5 + 9 = 15 in base-10. Since 15 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-11, we write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost place value, including the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + 5 = 7 in base-10, which is also 7 in base-11. So, we write down 7.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{74A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n8 + 5 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, along with the carry-over.\n\n4 + 7 + 1 (carry-over) = 12 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 12). So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost place value, along with the carry-over.\n\n8 + 7 + 1 (carry-over) = 16 in base-10, which is equal to 15 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0 = 16).

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost digit (ones place): 1 + 1 = 2\n2. Middle digit (elevens place): A + A = 10 + 10 = 20. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra value. 20 in base-11 is 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n3. Leftmost digit (121s place): 4 + 2 + 1 (carried over) = 7\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 7A2\n\nSo, 4A1 + 2A1 in base-11 is \\boxed{7A2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers A19 and 400 to base-10.\n\nA in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, A19 in base-11 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n\n(10 * 11^2) + (1 * 11^1) + (9 * 11^0) = (10 * 121) + (1 * 11) + (9 * 1) = 1200 + 11 + 9 = 1220\n\nNow, let's convert 400 in base-11 to base-10:\n\n(4 * 11^2) + (0 * 11^1) + (0 * 11^0) = (4 * 121) + (0 * 11) + (0 * 1) = 484 + 0 + 0 = 484\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers:\n\n1220 + 484 = 1704\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform successive divisions by 11 and keep track of the remainders:\n\n1704 \xf7 11 = 154 remainder 6\n154 \xf7 11 = 14 remainder 0\n14 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 3\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the result in base-11 as 306.\n\nSo, A19 + 400 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{306} in base-11.

In base-11, this is equivalent to 12 in base-10, which is 1 more than the highest digit in base-11. So, we carry over 1 and write down 2.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over: 9 + 4 + 1. In base-11, this is equivalent to 14 in base-10, which is 3 more than the highest digit in base-11. So, we carry over 1 and write down 3.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: A + 4 + 1. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 4 + 1 is 15 in base-10, which is 4 more than the highest digit in base-11. So, we write down 14.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result: \\boxed{1423}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column: 3 + A. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, 3 + 10 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 3 (13 - 10) in the middle column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, the result is 931 + 3A6 = \\boxed{937}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 0 + 2. Since we are in base-11, this addition remains the same as in base-10.\n\n0 + 2 = 2\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the "elevens" place) and add A + 2. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, we have:\n\n10 + 2 = 12\n\nSince 12 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over 1 to the next column (the "hundreds" place) and write down the remainder after dividing 12 by 11:\n\n12 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 1\n\nSo, we write down 1 in the "elevens" place and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the "hundreds" place, including the carry-over: A + 7 + 1. In base-11, A represents the value 10.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (5 and A). In base-11, A represents 10. So, 5 + 10 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. The rightmost digit of the sum is 4 (15 - 11).\n\nStep 2: Add the middle digits (7 and 3) and the carry-over (1). So, 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. Since 11 is equal to the base, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. The middle digit of the sum is 0 (11 - 11).\n\nStep 3: Add the leftmost digits (3 and 8) and the carry-over (1). So, 3 + 8 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. The leftmost digit of the sum is 1 (12 - 11).\n\nStep 4: Since we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final sum is 1040.\n\nTherefore, 375 + 83A in base-11 is \\boxed{1040}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 5 + 4 = 9, and 9 + 1 = 10, which is equal to 10 in base-11. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 5 + A + 1. In base-11, A is equal to 10, so we have 5 + 10 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 11, we need to carry over again. In base-11, 16 is equal to 15, which is 10 + 5. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we write down the carry-over 1 in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, the sum of 558 and A43 in base-11 is \\boxed{10500}.

First, let's break down the numbers 29A and 282 in base-11.\n\n29A in base-11 means (2 \xd7 11\xb2) + (9 \xd7 11\xb9) + (10 \xd7 11\u2070) = 242 + 99 + 10 = 351 in base-10.\n\n282 in base-11 means (2 \xd7 11\xb2) + (8 \xd7 11\xb9) + (2 \xd7 11\u2070) = 242 + 88 + 2 = 332 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 351 + 332 = 683.\n\nNow, we need to convert 683 back to base-11. \n\nTo do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 683 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 683 \xf7 11 = 62 (quotient) with a remainder of 1. This means 683 = 62 \xd7 11 + 1.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (62) by 11 again: 62 \xf7 11 = 5 (quotient) with a remainder of 7. This means 62 = 5 \xd7 11 + 7.\n\n3. Since the quotient (5) is less than 11, we can stop here.\n\nNow, we can write 683 in base-11 as 571 (5 \xd7 11\xb2) + (7 \xd7 11\xb9) + (1 \xd7 11\u2070).\n\nSo, 29A + 282 in base-11 is equal to 571 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{571}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + 6 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 14 in base-11 (since 13 in base-10 is 1*11^1 + 4*11^0). So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, along with the carry-over.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + 9 = 19 in base-10, which is equal to 1A in base-11 (since 19 in base-10 is 1*11^1 + 10*11^0).

So, we write down a 9 in the rightmost column of the result.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column: 6 (from A66) + 8 (from 283). In base-11, 6 + 8 = 14. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down a 3 in the middle column of the result.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + A (from A66) + 2 (from 283). In base-11, A is equal to 10. So, 1 + 10 + 2 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 10, we need to represent it in base-11. In base-11, 13 is represented as 1A.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A39.

So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the second column from the right, along with the carry-over: 8 + 3 + 1. In base-11, this is equal to 12, which we write as 21 (since 1 * 11^0 + 2 * 11^1 = 12). So, we write down 1 and carry over 2 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 2 + A + 2. In base-11, A is equal to 10, so we have 2 + 10 + 2 = 14. In base-11, this is equal to 31 (since 1 * 11^0 + 3 * 11^1 = 14). So, we write down 31.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 31A1.\n\nSo, 282 + A38 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{31A1}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers A8A and A69 in base-11, we'll start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: A + 9. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1. The rightmost digit of the sum is 8 (19 - 11).\n\n2. Add the middle digits along with the carry-over: 8 + 6 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1. The middle digit of the sum is 4 (15 - 11).\n\n3. Add the leftmost digits along with the carry-over: A + A + 1. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 10 + 1 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1. The leftmost digit of the sum is A (21 - 11).\n\nSo, the sum of A8A and A69 in base-11 is 1A48.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1A48}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 4 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 4 + 10 = 14. In base-11, 14 is represented as 13 (1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0), so we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 7 + 8 + 1. In base-10, this is 16. In base-11, 16 is represented as 15 (1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0), so we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1. In base-10, this is 1. In base-11, 1 is represented as 1 (1 * 11^0).\n\nPutting all the results together, we get the final sum: 153. So, 7A4 + 8AA in base-11 is \\boxed{153}.

To do this, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 947 by 11^2 (121) to find the coefficient of the 11^2 term:\n   947 \xf7 121 = 7 (remainder 110)\n\n2. Divide the remainder (110) by 11^1 (11) to find the coefficient of the 11^1 term:\n   110 \xf7 11 = 10 (remainder 0)\n\n3.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down 4 (15 in base-11 is 14).\n\n3. 1 + 5 (from the carry-over) = 6\n\nSo, the result is 64B.

In base-10, this would be 10, but since we are in base-11, it is represented as A. So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 2 + 3. In base-10, this would be 6, and since 6 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over any value. So, we write down 6.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: A + 9. In base-10, this would be 10 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 and write down the remainder when 19 is divided by 11, which is 8.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A68.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  45A\n+ A74\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have A + 4. In base-11, A represents 10, so 10 + 4 = 14. Since 14 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 4 - 1 = 3. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 3.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n```\n  1\n  45A\n+ A74\n-----\n    3\n```\n\nWe have 5 + 7 + 1 (the carry-over) = 13. Since 13 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 13 - 11 = 2. So, the middle digit of the sum is 2.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n```\n  1\n  45A\n+ A74\n-----\n   23\n```\n\nWe have 4 + A + 1 (the carry-over) = 4 + 10 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down the remainder, which is 15 - 11 = 4. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is 4.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 45A + A74 = 423 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{423}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 5 + 8. In base-10, this would be 13. However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 13 as 1 set of 11 and 2 remaining. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 1 + 4 + 1. In base-10, this would be 6. Since 6 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over anything.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 1 + 4. In base-10, this would be 5. Since 5 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over anything.\n\nSo, the result is 562 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{562}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the coefficient for 11^1 is 7.\n\nThe remainder is 6, which is the coefficient for 11^0.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 1476.\n\nTherefore, A40 + 41A in base-11 is \\boxed{1476}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n5 + 9 = 14 in base-10, which is 15 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0 = 14). So, we write down 5 and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, including the carry-over.\n\n7 + 3 + 1 (carry-over) = 11 in base-10, which is 10 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0 = 11). So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the last place value, including the carry-over.\n\n8 + 1 + 1 (carry-over) = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-11 (since A represents 10 in base-11).\n\nNow, let's put all the digits together: A05.\n\nSo, 875 + 139 in base-11 is \\boxed{A05}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the middle column: 1 + A. In base-11, A represents 10, so 1 + 10 = 11. Since we are in base-11, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 807 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{807}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 8 + 4. In base-11, 8 + 4 = 12, which is written as 10 in base-11. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 9 (from 9A8) + 9 (from 794) + 1 (carry-over) = 19 in base-11. Since 19 in base-11 is equal to 1A, we write down an A and carry over a 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (from the carry-over) + 7 (from 794) = 8.\n\nSo, the final result is 8A0 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{8A0}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n6 + 7 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 11 + 2 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, including the carry-over.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + 8 = 10 in base-10, which is equal to A in base-11 (since 10 is represented by A in base-11). So, we write down A and there is no carry-over this time.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost place value.\n\n4 + 1 = 5 in base-10, which is also 5 in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum of 416 and 187 in base-11 is 5A2.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{5A2}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 3 + 6. In base-10, this would be 9, which is the same in base-11. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 9.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column and add 0 + 4. In base-10, this would be 4, which is the same in base-11. So, the second digit from the right in the sum is 4.\n\nNext, let's add 6 + A. In base-10, A is equal to 10, so 6 + 10 = 16. Since base-11 only goes up to A, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column. So, the third digit from the right in the sum is 6 (16 - 11).\n\nFinally, we have the carried-over 1 from the previous step. So, the leftmost digit in the sum is 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 603 + A46 = \\boxed{1469}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers 66A and 76A in base-11.\n\n66A in base-11 means (6 * 11^2) + (6 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = 726 + 66 + 10 = 802.\n\n76A in base-11 means (7 * 11^2) + (6 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = 847 + 66 + 10 = 923.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers: 802 + 923 = 1725.\n\nNow, we need to convert 1725 back to base-11. \n\n1725 / 11^2 = 1725 / 121 \u2248 14 with a remainder of 49. So, we have 14 in the 11^2 place.\n\n49 / 11^1 = 49 / 11 \u2248 4 with a remainder of 5. So, we have 4 in the 11^1 place.\n\nFinally, we have 5 in the 11^0 place.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the base-11 number: 1445.\n\nSo, 66A + 76A in base-11 is \\boxed{1445}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n7 + 0 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\nNow, let's move to the middle column.\n\n4 + 8 = 12 in base-11, which is written as "10". So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n1 (carried over) + 4 + 7 = 12 in base-11, which is written as "10". So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nSince there are no more columns, we write down the carried over 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 447 and 780 in base-11 is 1007.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1007}.

Since we are in base-11, we have:\n\n4 + 6 = 10 (in base-10) = A (in base-11)\n\nNow, let's move to the next column and add the numbers: 7 + 2. Since we are in base-11, we have:\n\n7 + 2 = 9 (in base-10) = 9 (in base-11)\n\nHowever, we need to carry over the 1 from the previous column. So, we add 1 to the result:\n\n9 + 1 = 10 (in base-10) = A (in base-11)\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column and add the numbers: 8 + nothing. Since we are in base-11, we have:\n\n8 + 0 = 8 (in base-10) = 8 (in base-11)\n\nPutting all the results together, we get:\n\n7A4 + 826 = 8AA\n\nSo, the final result is \\boxed{8AA}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 4 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 4 + 10 = 14 in base-10. To convert it back to base-11, we have 14 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 3. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Middle column: 5 + 9 + 1 (carry-over). In base-10, this is 5 + 9 + 1 = 15. To convert it back to base-11, we have 15 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 4. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Leftmost column: 9 + 7 + 1 (carry-over). In base-10, this is 9 + 7 + 1 = 17. To convert it back to base-11, we have 17 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 6. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there is a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 (ones place) + 5 (ones place) = 12 in base-11, which is equal to 10 in base-10.

First, let's add the numbers in base-11 just like we would in base-10, but carrying over when the sum is greater than or equal to 11.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n5 + A: Since A in base-11 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, 5 + A = 5 + 10 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 11, we carry over 1 and write down 4 (15 - 11) as the rightmost digit.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit:\n9 + 3 + 1 (carried over): 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 11, we carry over 1 and write down 2 (13 - 11) as the next digit.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit:\n5 + 1 (carried over): 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nSo, the result is 624 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n5 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 5 + 10 (in base-10), which is 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 5 (15 - 10).\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 7 + 1 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous column). This is equivalent to 7 + 1 + 1 (in base-10), which is 9. There is no need to carry over, so the middle digit of the sum is 9.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column. We have A + 3, which is equivalent to 10 + 3 (in base-10), which is 13. Since 13 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to an additional column. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is 3 (13 - 10), and we have an additional digit of 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum A75 + 31A = 1A95 (in base-11).\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1A95}.

First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column: 2 + A. In base-11, A represents 10, so 2 + 10 = 12.

Since we are in base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (elevens place) along with the carry-over: 6 + 4 + 1 = 11. In base-11, 11 is equal to 10 * 1 + 1 * 1, so we write down "1" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (121s place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 6 + 1 = 9. We don't need to carry over anything this time, so we just write down "9".\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{91A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".

To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 881 by 11 and find the remainder:\n   881 \xf7 11 = 80 with a remainder of 1. This means that the digit in the 11\u2070 place is 1.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (80) by 11 and find the remainder:\n   80 \xf7 11 = 7 with a remainder of 3. This means that the digit in the 11\xb9 place is 3.\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (7) by 11 and find the remainder:\n   7 \xf7 11 = 0 with a remainder of 7. This means that the digit in the 11\xb2 place is 7.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 731.

Since we are in base-11, we have:\n\n7 + 5 = 12 (in base-10)\n\nBut in base-11, 12 is represented as 10 + 2, which is written as "12". So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 1 + 1. In base-11, this is:\n\n2 + 1 + 1 = 4 (in base-10)\n\nThere is no need to carry over any number this time.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 121s place): 2 + 7. In base-11, this is:\n\n2 + 7 = 9 (in base-10)\n\nNow, we can combine the results from each column to get the final sum:\n\n9 (from the 121s place) + 4 (from the 11s place) + 2 (from the 1s place) = 942 (in base-11)\n\nSo, the result is: \\boxed{942}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n5 + 9 = 14 in base-10, which is 13 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0 = 14). So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next place value.\n\n1 (carried over) + 8 + 5 = 14 in base-10, which is 13 in base-11. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost place value.\n\n1 (carried over) + A + 8 = 1 + 10 + 8 = 19 in base-10, which is 1A in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 19).\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result:\n\nA85 + 859 = \\boxed{1A33} in base-11.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 88A+540? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the numbers into their place values in base-11:\n\n88A = 8 * 11^2 + 8 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0\n540 = 5 * 11^2 + 4 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0\n\nNow, let's calculate the values:\n\n88A = 8 * 121 + 8 * 11 + 10 * 1 = 968 + 88 + 10 = 1066\n540 = 5 * 121 + 4 * 11 + 0 * 1 = 605 + 44 + 0 = 649\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers:\n\n1066 + 649 = 1715\n\nNow, we need to convert this number back to base-11. We'll do this by finding the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 1715 and then working our way down:\n\n11^3 = 1331 (too large)\n11^2 = 121 (fits)\n\n1715 - 121 * 14 = 15 (14 is the largest multiple of 121 that is less than or equal to 1715)\n\nNow, we move to the next place value:\n\n11^1 = 11 (fits)\n\n15 - 11 * 1 = 4 (1 is the largest multiple of 11 that is less than or equal to 15)\n\nFinally, we have the last place value:\n\n11^0 = 1 (fits)\n\n4 - 1 * 4 = 0 (4 is the largest multiple of 1 that is less than or equal to 4)\n\nSo, the base-11 representation of the sum is 1414. Therefore, the result is:\n\n\\boxed{1414}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is AA9+343? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 9 + 3. In base-11, 9 + 3 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2. So far, we have:\n\n```\n  AA9\n+ 343\n-----\n    2\n```\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over: A + 4 + 1. In base-11, A is equal to 10. So, 10 + 4 + 1 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 5. Our result now looks like:\n\n```\n  AA9\n+ 343\n-----\n   52\n```\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: A + 3 + 1. In base-11, A is equal to 10. So, 10 + 3 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is less than 11^2 (which is 121), we don't need to carry over any more digits. We can simply write down 14 as the leftmost digits. Our final result is:\n\n```\n  AA9\n+ 343\n-----\n  1452\n```\n\nSo, AA9 + 343 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1452}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-10, this would be 15, but we need to convert it to base-11. Since 15 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-11, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (tens place) along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 0 + 9. In base-10, this would be 10, but we need to convert it to base-11. Since 10 in base-10 is equal to A in base-11, we write down A.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (hundreds place): 2 + 8. In base-10, this would be 10, but we need to convert it to base-11. Since 10 in base-10 is equal to A in base-11, we write down A.\n\nSo, the sum of 207 and 988 in base-11 is A4A.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to represent 13 as 1 set of 11 and 2 remaining units. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 9 + 6 + 1. In base-10, this would be 16. In base-11, we represent 16 as 1 set of 11 and 5 remaining units. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column along with the carry-over: A + 7 + 1. In base-10, A is equal to 10, so we have 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. In base-11, we represent 18 as 1 set of 11 and 7 remaining units. So, we write down 17.\n\nPutting it all together, we have A98 + 765 = 1752 in base-11. So, the result is \\boxed{1752}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 17 is represented as 16. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we have the carry-over 1, which we write down as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the sum A53 + 672 in base-11 is \\boxed{1625}.

Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra digit. So, 12 in base-11 is 10 + 1 = A1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (ones place): 5 + 9. Since we are in base-11, we know that 10 is represented by the letter "A". So, 5 + 9 = 14, which is equal to 1A in base-11. We write down the "A" and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (elevens place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 8 + 1 = 12.

Rightmost column: 5 + 1 = 6\n2. Middle column: 8 + 3 = B (since 11 in base-11 is represented by A, and 8 + 3 = 11)\n3. Leftmost column: 2 + A = 2 + 10 = 12 (since A represents 10 in base-11)\n\nSince 12 is greater than the base-11 maximum digit A, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the leftmost column becomes 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThus, the sum of 285 and A31 in base-11 is \\boxed{3B6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  91A\n+889\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. A (which is 10 in base-10) + 9 = 19 in base-10.

In base-10, this would be 11, but in base-11, it is represented as 10. So, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + A + 8. In base-10, A is equal to 10, so we have 1 + 10 + 8 = 19. In base-11, 19 is represented as 18 (since 1 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0 = 19). So, we write down an 8 and carry over a 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 5 = 7.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 780.\n\nSo, 1A6 + 585 in base-11 is \\boxed{780}.

First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier.\n\nThe number 30A in base-11 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n(3 \xd7 11^2) + (0 \xd7 11^1) + (10 \xd7 11^0) = (3 \xd7 121) + (0 \xd7 11) + (10 \xd7 1) = 363 + 0 + 10 = 373.\n\nThe number 274 in base-11 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n(2 \xd7 11^2) + (7 \xd7 11^1) + (4 \xd7 11^0) = (2 \xd7 121) + (7 \xd7 11) + (4 \xd7 1) = 242 + 77 + 4 = 323.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers:\n373 + 323 = 696.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 696 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder:\n   696 \xf7 11 = 63, remainder 3.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (63) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder:\n   63 \xf7 11 = 5, remainder 8.\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (5) by 11 and find the final quotient and remainder:\n   5 \xf7 11 = 0, remainder 5.\n\nNow, we'll use the remainders to construct the base-11 number, starting with the last remainder and working our way up:\n5, 8, 3.\n\nSo, 30A + 274 in base-11 is equal to 583 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{583}.

First, let's break down the numbers 16A and A84 into their base-10 equivalents.\n\n16A in base-11 means 1 * 11^2 + 6 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0 = 121 + 66 + 10 = 197 in base-10.\n\nA84 in base-11 means 10 * 11^2 + 8 * 11^1 + 4 * 11^0 = 1210 + 88 + 4 = 1302 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two base-10 numbers: 197 + 1302 = 1499.\n\nNow, we need to convert 1499 back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 1499 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 1499 \xf7 11 = 136 with a remainder of 3. So, the least significant digit (rightmost digit) is 3.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (136) by 11: 136 \xf7 11 = 12 with a remainder of 4. So, the next digit to the left is 4.\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (12) by 11: 12 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 1. So, the next digit to the left is 1.\n\n4. Since the last quotient is less than 11, we have reached the end of the conversion. The leftmost digit is the last quotient, which is 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the base-11 number 143.\n\nSo, 16A + A84 in base-11 is \\boxed{143}.

We write down the "A" and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 8 + 0 + 1. This gives us 9. So, we write down the "9".\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: A + 7. In base-11, A represents 10. So, 10 + 7 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 10, we need to represent it in base-11. 17 in base-11 is 1A.\n\nSo, the final result is 1A9A. Therefore, the sum of 8A7 and 709 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A9A}.

Since 9 + 4 = 13 in base-10, we need to convert it to base-11. 13 in base-10 is equal to 12 in base-11, which can be written as 10 + 2. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (11s place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 8 + 1. Since 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 in base-10, we need to convert it to base-11. 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, which can be written as 10 + 3. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (121s place) along with the carry-over: 2 + 1. Since 2 + 1 = 3 in base-10, we don't need to convert it to base-11 as it is already in base-11.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get the final answer: \\boxed{332}.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the other 1.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the third column, considering the carry-over: 8 + A + 1. In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 8 + 10 + 1 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 8.\n\nFinally, let's consider the carry-over in the fourth column: 1. Since there are no other numbers to add in this column, we simply write down the 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 871 and A45 in base-11 is \\boxed{18A6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 0 + 3. Since we are in base-11, this addition remains the same as in base-10.\n\n0 + 3 = 3\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the "tens" place). We have A + 4. In base-11, A represents the value 10. So, we have:\n\n10 + 4 = 14\n\nSince 14 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over the extra value to the next column. To do this, we subtract the base from the sum and carry over the remaining value:\n\n14 - 11 = 3\n\nSo, we write down 3 in the "tens" place and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column (the "hundreds" place). We have 1 (the carried-over value) + 1 + 8:\n\n1 + 1 + 8 = 10\n\nSince 10 is equal to the base (11), we don't need to carry over any value to the next column.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n1A0 + 843 = 1033\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1033}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (units place): 5 + 7. In base-10, this would be 12, but in base-11, we represent 12 as 10 + 2, which is written as "12".

To add A63 and 340 in base-11, we'll start from the rightmost digit and move to the left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 3 + 0 = 3.\n2. Add the middle digits: 6 + 4 = A (since 10 in base-10 is A in base-11).\n3. Add the leftmost digits: A + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 in base-10.

First, let's break down the numbers A31 and 76A into their place values in base-11.\n\nA31 = (10 * 11^2) + (3 * 11^1) + (1 * 11^0) = 1210 + 33 + 1 = 1244\n\n76A = (7 * 11^2) + (6 * 11^1) + (10 * 11^0) = 847 + 66 + 10 = 923\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers together:\n\n1244 + 923 = 2167\n\nNow, let's convert this number back into base-11:\n\n2167 \xf7 11^2 = 2167 \xf7 121 \u2248 17, remainder 110\n17 \xf7 11^1 = 17 \xf7 11 \u2248 1, remainder 6\n110 \xf7 11^0 = 110 \xf7 1 = 110\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 1A60.\n\nTherefore, A31 + 76A in base-11 is \\boxed{1A60}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 8 + 6. In base-11, this is equivalent to 14 in base-10. Since 14 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 as the rightmost digit of the sum.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, including the carry-over: 5 + 9 + 1. In base-11, this is equivalent to 15 in base-10. Since 15 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 5 as the middle digit of the sum.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, including the carry-over: 6 + A + 1. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, we have 6 + 10 + 1, which is equivalent to 17 in base-10. Since 17 is less than 11^2 (which is 121 in base-10), we don't need to carry over any more digits. We can simply write down 17 in base-11 as 17.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 658 + A96 = \\boxed{1754}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. Rightmost column: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Second column from the right: 1 + 8 = 9\n3. Third column from the right: 9 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 9 + 10 = 19. In base-11, 19 is represented as 1A (1 * 11^1 + 10 * 11^0). So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, taking the carry-over into account, we have:\n\n1. Fourth column from the left: 1 (carry-over) = 1\n\nSo, the final result is 1A94. Therefore, 911+A83 in base-11 is \\boxed{1A94}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, A represents 10, so we have 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over again. 18 in base-11 is represented as 1(11) + 7, so we write down 17.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we have the result: \\boxed{1726}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 2 + 10 (in base-10). So, 2 + 10 = 12 (in base-10). Since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 2 (12 - 10) and we carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, including the carry-over.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + 3 = 5 (in base-10). Since 5 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over any value to the next place value. So, the middle digit of the sum is 5.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost place value.\n\n2 + 5 = 7 (in base-10). Since 7 is less than 11, we don't need to carry over any value. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is 7.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 212 + 53A (in base-11) = \\boxed{752} (in base-11).	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Again, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Leftmost digit (121s place): 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 7 = 9. No need to carry over this time.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 9 (leftmost) 2 (middle) 2 (rightmost).\n\nSo, 184 + 738 in base-11 is \\boxed{922}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculation easier.\n\nThe number 15A in base-11 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n(1 \xd7 11^2) + (5 \xd7 11^1) + (10 \xd7 11^0) = 121 + 55 + 10 = 186.\n\nThe number 290 in base-11 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n(2 \xd7 11^2) + (9 \xd7 11^1) + (0 \xd7 11^0) = 242 + 99 + 0 = 341.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers:\n186 + 341 = 527.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 527 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder:\n   527 \xf7 11 = 47 (quotient) with a remainder of 10. So, the rightmost digit is A.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (47) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder:\n   47 \xf7 11 = 4 (quotient) with a remainder of 3. So, the next digit to the left is 3.\n\n3. Since the quotient (4) is less than 11, it becomes the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the final result in base-11 is 43A.\n\nTherefore, 15A + 290 in base-11 is \\boxed{43A}.

So, we write down 7 and carry over the 1.\n3. In the leftmost column, we have 9 + A + 1 (the carry-over). This is equivalent to 9 + 10 + 1 = 20 in base-10. In base-11, 20 is represented as 18 (1 * 11^1 + 8 * 11^0).\n\nSo, the sum of 9A1 and A80 in base-11 is 187. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{187}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column (the 1s place): 6 + 4. Since 6 + 4 = 10 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the 1s place.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column (the 11s place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 8 + 1. Since 5 + 8 + 1 = 14 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 in the 11s place.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (the 121s place) along with the carry-over: 3 + 3 + 1. Since 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 in base-10, we write down 7 in the 121s place.\n\nSo, the result is 740 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{740}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, the coefficient for 11^2 is A.\n\nNow, we move on to the next place value:\n\n99 \xf7 11 = 9 with a remainder of 0. So, the coefficient for 11^1 is 9.\n\nFinally, the remainder is 0, so the coefficient for 11^0 is 0.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n\\boxed{A90}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-10, A is equal to 10, so we have 1 + 10 + 3 = 14. Since 14 is greater than 10, we need to carry over again. We write down a 4 and carry over a 1.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 9 = 11. In base-11, this is equal to 10.

We write down "4" and there is no carry-over this time.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 5 + A. In base-11, A represents 10, so 5 + 10 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 11, we need to carry-over. 15 in base-11 is represented as "14", so we write down "4" and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have a carry-over of 1, so we write down "1" in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, the sum of 519 and A21 in base-11 is \\boxed{14A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n5 + 9 = 14 (in base-10), which is 15 in base-11. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n7 + 1 + 1 (the carry-over) = 9 (in base-10), which is 9 in base-11. So, we write down 9.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit.\n\nA (which is 10 in base-10) + 3 = 13 (in base-10), which is 12 in base-11. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there is a carry-over, we need to add one more digit to the left.\n\n1 (the carry-over) = 1 in base-11.\n\nSo, the final result is 1295 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the sum is \\boxed{1295}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A57+A37? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A57 and A37 in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have 7 + 7. In base-11, 7 + 7 = E. So, we write down E and carry over nothing to the next column.\n\n2. In the middle column (elevens place), we have 5 + 3. In base-11, 5 + 3 = 8. So, we write down 8 and carry over nothing to the next column.\n\n3. In the leftmost column (121s place), we have A + A. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, A + A = 10 + 10 = 20. Since 20 is greater than the base (11), we need to carry over. To find the carry-over, we divide 20 by 11 and get 1 as the quotient and 9 as the remainder. So, we write down 9 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n4. Since we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, our final result is 198E in base-11.\n\nTherefore, A57 + A37 in base-11 is \\boxed{198E}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n6 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 6 + 10 (in base-10). So, 6 + 10 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carried over) + 5 + 0 = 6.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column.\n\n5 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 5 + 10 (in base-10). So, 5 + 10 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to an additional column. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have 1 (carried over) in the additional column.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result:\n\n1 6 4 5\n\nSo, the sum of 5A6 and A0A in base-11 is \\boxed{1645}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Rightmost digit (ones place): 7 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 7 + 10 = 17 in base-10. To convert this back to base-11, we have 17 \xf7 11 = 1 remainder 6. So, we write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Middle digit (elevens place): 1 (carry-over) + 1 + 5 = 7 in base-10. There's no need to carry over anything here.\n\n3.

First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  375\n+ 24A\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n5 + A: Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, 5 + A = 5 + 10 = 15. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n7 + 4 + 1 (carry-over): 7 + 4 + 1 = 12.

First, let's break down the numbers A53 and 100 in base-11.\n\nA53 in base-11 represents:\nA * 11^2 + 5 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0\n10 * 121 + 5 * 11 + 3 * 1\n1210 + 55 + 3\n= 1268 in base-10\n\n100 in base-11 represents:\n1 * 11^2 + 0 * 11^1 + 0 * 11^0\n121 + 0 + 0\n= 121 in base-10\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10:\n1268 + 121 = 1389\n\nNow, we need to convert 1389 back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 1389 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder:\n1389 \xf7 11 = 126, remainder 3\n\n2. Divide the quotient (126) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder:\n126 \xf7 11 = 11, remainder 5\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (11) by 11 and find the final quotient and remainder:\n11 \xf7 11 = 1, remainder 0\n\n4. The final quotient is 1, which is less than 11, so we stop here.\n\nNow, we'll use the remainders to construct the base-11 number, starting with the last remainder and working our way up:\n1 * 11^2 + 0 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0\n\nSo, A53 + 100 in base-11 is 1053.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{1053}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 5 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 5 + 10 = 15 in base-10. In base-11, 15 is represented as 14, so we write down a 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 3 + 2 + 1.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n4 + 9 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, along with the carry-over.\n\n3 + 9 + 1 (carry-over) = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1 again.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost place value, along with the carry-over.\n\n7 + 5 + 1 (carry-over) = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11.\n\nSo, the final result is 1222 in base-11.\n\n\\boxed{1222}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n8 + 5 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 14 in base-11 (since 13 in base-10 is 1*11^1 + 1*11^0). So, we write down 4 and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, including the carry-over.\n\n2 + 2 + 1 (carry-over) = 5 in base-10, which is also 5 in base-11. So, we write down 5.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the last place value.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 in base-10, which is also 4 in base-11.

Since 0 + 4 = 4, we write down 4 in the units place of the result.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the middle column (tens place): 5 + 6. Since 5 + 6 = 11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 0 in the tens place of the result and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column (hundreds place) along with the carry-over: 5 + 2 + 1. Since 5 + 2 + 1 = 8, we write down 8 in the hundreds place of the result.\n\nSo, the final result is 804. Therefore, 550 + 264 in base-11 is \\boxed{804}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n8 + 8 = 16 in base-10, which is 15 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0 = 16). So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the second column from the right.\n\n2 + 3 + 1 (carry-over) = 6 in base-10, which is 6 in base-11. So, we write down 6.\n\nNext, let's move to the third column from the right.\n\n2 + A = 2 + 10 (since A represents 10 in base-11) = 12 in base-10, which is 11 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 1 * 11^0 = 12).

First, let's add the numbers in base-11 just like we would in base-10, but carrying over when the sum is greater than or equal to 11.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we have 8 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 8 + 10 = 18. Since 18 is greater than or equal to 11, we carry over 1 and write down the remainder, which is 18 - 11 = 7.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit. We have 4 + 7, plus the carry-over 1, which gives us 4 + 7 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than or equal to 11, we carry over 1 and write down the remainder, which is 12 - 11 = 1.\n\nFinally, we have 2 + 0, plus the carry-over 1, which gives us 2 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the result is 248 + 70A = 317 in base-11.

Since we are in base-11, 10 is represented by the digit "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 3 + 9 = 13. In base-11, 13 is represented as "12", so we write down "2" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 6 + A. Since A represents 10 in base-11, we have 1 + 6 + 10 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented as "16", so we write down "6" and carry over 1.\n\nSince there is nothing left to add, we just write down the carry-over "1" in the leftmost position.\n\nSo, the sum of 637 and A93 in base-11 is \\boxed{162A}.

Units place: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Tens place: 7 + 1 = 8\n3. Hundreds place: 8 + 4 = 12. Since we are in base-11, we write 12 as 10 + 2 = A2. So, we write 2 in the hundreds place and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nNow, we have:\n\n  871\n+413\n-----\n  824\n\nBut we need to add the carry-over from the hundreds place:\n\n  1000\n  824\n-----\n  A24\n\nSo, the sum of 871 and 413 in base-11 is \\boxed{A24}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 4A9+455? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in the rightmost column: 9 + 5. Since we are in base-11, we have:\n\n9 + 5 = 14 (in base-10)\n\nHowever, we need to convert this to base-11. 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, which can be written as 1A. So, we write down A and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 4 + 5 + 1. In base-10, this is:\n\n4 + 5 + 1 = 10\n\nIn base-11, 10 is represented by A. So, we write down A.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column: 4 + 4. In base-10, this is:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\nSince 8 is the same in both base-10 and base-11, we write down 8.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result:\n\n\\boxed{8AA}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 144+159? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n```\n 144\n+159\n```\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 4 + 9 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n```\n  1\n 144\n+159\n-----\n   2\n```\n\n2. Now, let's add the middle column: 1 (carried over) + 4 + 5 = 10 in base-10, which is equal to A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 0 (since there's no need to carry over anything).\n\n```\n 144\n+159\n-----\n  A2\n```\n\n3. Finally, let's add the leftmost column: 1 + 1 = 2 in base-11. So, we write down 2.\n\n```\n 144\n+159\n-----\n 2A2\n```\n\nSo, 144 + 159 in base-11 is equal to 2A2 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{2A2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 152+71A? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 2 + 10 (in base-10). So, 2 + 10 = 12. Since we are in base-11, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 1 as the rightmost digit of the result.\n\nNow, let's move to the next place value.\n\n(1 + 5 + 7) (in base-11) is equivalent to (1 + 5 + 7) (in base-10). So, 1 + 5 + 7 = 13. Since we are in base-11, we carry over 1 to the next place value and write down 2 as the next digit of the result.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost place value.\n\n(1 + 1) (in base-11) is equivalent to (1 + 1) (in base-10). So, 1 + 1 = 2. We write down 2 as the leftmost digit of the result.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result as 2211 in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum of 152 and 71A in base-11 is \\boxed{2211}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + 8 = A (since 10 in base-10 is A in base-11)\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit.\n\n8 + 7 = 15 in base-10. Since 15 in base-10 is equal to 14 in base-11, we have:\n\n15 (base-10) = 14 (base-11)\n\nSo, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over:\n\n7 + 8 + 1 (carry-over) = 16 in base-10. Since 16 in base-10 is equal to 15 in base-11, we have:\n\n16 (base-10) = 15 (base-11)\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{154A}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  803\n+ 90A\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 3 + A: Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, 3 + A = 3 + 10 = 13. In base-11, 13 is represented as 12 (1*11^1 + 2*11^0). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n  1\n  803\n+ 90A\n-----\n    2\n\n2. 0 + 9 + 1 (carry-over): 0 + 9 + 1 = 10. In base-11, 10 is represented as A. So, we write down A and carry over 0 to the next column.\n\n  803\n+ 90A\n-----\n   A2\n\n3. 8 + 0 + 0 (carry-over): 8 + 0 + 0 = 8.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers A94 and A60 from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA94 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^2) + (9 * 11^1) + (4 * 11^0) = 1210 + 99 + 4 = 1313 in base-10.\n\nA60 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^2) + (6 * 11^1) + (0 * 11^0) = 1210 + 66 + 0 = 1276 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 1313 + 1276 = 2589.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 2589 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 2589 \xf7 11 = 235 with a remainder of 4. Write down the remainder (4).\n\n2. Divide the quotient (235) by 11: 235 \xf7 11 = 21 with a remainder of 4. Write down the remainder (4).\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (21) by 11: 21 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 10. Write down the remainder (A).\n\n4. The final quotient (1) is less than 11, so we write it down as the leftmost digit.\n\nPutting all the remainders and the final quotient together, we get the base-11 number 1AA4.\n\nSo, A94 + A60 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{1AA4}.

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nUnits place: 9 + 9 = 12 (in base-10), which is equal to 10 + 2 = A2 (in base-11). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nTens place: 0 + 2 + 1 (carry over) = 3 (in base-11).\n\nHundreds place: 9 + 4 = 13 (in base-10), which is equal to 11 + 2 = B2 (in base-11).

Units place: 8 + 6 = 14 (in base-10). Since 14 in base-10 is equal to 13 in base-11, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Tens place: 0 + 7 + 1 (carry-over) = 8 (in base-10). There is no need to carry over since 8 is within the base-11 range.\n\n3. Hundreds place: 9 + 8 = 17 (in base-10). Since 17 in base-10 is equal to 16 in base-11, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n4. Thousands place: 1 (carry-over) = 1 (in base-10). There is no need to carry over since 1 is within the base-11 range.\n\nSo, the result is 1633 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1633}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the middle column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 5 + 9. In base-11, 1 + 5 + 9 = 15, which we write as "4" with a carry-over of 1 (since 15 in base-11 is written as 14).\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the leftmost column, along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 6.
