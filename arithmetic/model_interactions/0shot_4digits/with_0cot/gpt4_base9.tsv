We write down 7 and there is no carry-over.\n\nStep 3: Add the 81's digits (6 + 4).\n6 + 4 = 10, which is 11 in base-9 (since 10 in base-10 is 1*9^1 + 1*9^0).

Since 3+8+1=12, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the second digit from the right of the sum is 2.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (8+6) and the carry-over (1). Since 8+6+1=15, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the third digit from the right of the sum is 5.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (3+2) and the carry-over (1). Since 3+2+1=6, there is no need to carry over.

Since 7 + 3 + 1 = 11, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over again. In base-9, 11 is represented as 12 (since 1 * 9^1 + 2 * 9^0 = 11). So, we write down 2 as the hundreds digit of the result and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 4: Add the carry-over from the previous step (1) to the thousands digits (0 + 4). Since 0 + 4 + 1 = 5, we write down 5 as the thousands digit of the result.\n\nSo, the final result is 5257. Therefore, 7684 + 4363 in base-9 is \\boxed{5257}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (7+4).

Since 14 is also a two-digit number in base-9, we write down the 4 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (7+1) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). So, 7+1+1=9. Since 9 is a one-digit number in base-10 but not in base-9, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (6+2) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). So, 6+2+1=9. Again, since 9 is a one-digit number in base-10 but not in base-9, we write down the 0 and carry over the 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 5: Since there are no more digits to add, we write down the carry-over from the previous step (1) as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the sum of 6757 and 2184 in base-9 is \\boxed{10401}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6+5). Since 6+5=11, which is a two-digit number in base-9, we write down the 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (8+1) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). So, 8+1+1=10. Since 10 is a two-digit number in base-9, we write down the 0 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (6+5) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). So, 6+5+1=12. Since 12 is a two-digit number in base-9, we write down the 2 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (6+2) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). So, 6+2+1=9. Since 9 is a one-digit number in base-10, we need to convert it to base-9. In base-9, 9 is represented as 10. So, we write down the 0 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 5: Since there is a carry-over from the previous step, we write down the 1 in the next column.\n\nSo, the sum of 6686 and 2515 in base-9 is \\boxed{10201}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the units digits (5 and 4). Since 5+4=9, we have a carry-over. So, we write down 0 and carry-over 1.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (8 and 0) along with the carry-over (1). Since 8+0+1=10, we have another carry-over. So, we write down 1 and carry-over 1.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (1 and 1) along with the carry-over (1). Since 1+1+1=3, there is no carry-over. So, we write down 3.\n\nStep 4: Since there are no more digits in the second number, we just write down the remaining digit from the first number (7).\n\nSo, the result is 7310. Therefore, 7185+1104 in base-9 is \\boxed{7310}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Again, 12 is greater than 8, so we need to carry over 1 to the next column. We write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 + 1 = 4 (base-9).

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-9 where the digits are "012345678", what is 3737+3648? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (7+8).

There is no need to carry over this time.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (7+6). Since 7+6=13, which is greater than 8, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (3+1) and the carry-over (1). So, 3+1+1=5.\n\nNow, putting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{5835}.
