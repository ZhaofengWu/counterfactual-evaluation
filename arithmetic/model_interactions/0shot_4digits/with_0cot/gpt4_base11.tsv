But we have a carry-over from the previous step, so we need to add 1 as well. A + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  A767\n+ 1172\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have 7 + 2. In base-11, this is simply 9, so we write down 9 and carry over 0.\n\nNext, we move to the second rightmost column, where we have 6 + 7. In base-10, this would be 13, but since we are in base-11, we need to carry over 1 and write down 2 (13 - 11 = 2).\n\nNow, we move to the third rightmost column, where we have A + 1, plus the carry-over of 1. In base-10, A is equivalent to 10, so we have 10 + 1 + 1 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 and write down 1 (12 - 11 = 1).\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost column, where we have 1 + 1, plus the carry-over of 1. This gives us 3.\n\nSo, the sum A767 + 1172 in base-11 is 3129. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{3129}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  1099\n+3A51\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 9 + 1 = A (since we are in base-11, A represents 10)\n2. 9 + 5 = E (9 + 5 = 14, which is 11 + 3, so we write 3 and carry over 1)\n3. 1 + A + 1 (carry-over) = 13 (which is 11 + 2, so we write 2 and carry over 1)\n4. 1 + 3 + 1 (carry-over) = 5\n\nSo, the result is 52EA. Therefore, the sum of 1099 and 3A51 in base-11 is \\boxed{52EA}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A79A and 6A1A in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have A + A. In base-11, A is equal to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 10 = 20. Since 20 is greater than 11, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 9 (20 - 11) in the rightmost column of the result.\n\n2. Moving to the next column, we have 9 + 1 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). In base-10, this is 9 + 1 + 1 = 11. Since 11 is equal to 11, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0 in the current column of the result.\n\n3. In the next column, we have 7 + A + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). In base-10, this is 7 + 10 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 11, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 7 (18 - 11) in the current column of the result.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have A + 6 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). In base-10, this is 10 + 6 + 1 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 11, we'll carry over 1 to a new leftmost column and write down 6 (17 - 11) in the current column of the result.\n\n5. Finally, we'll write down the carry-over 1 in a new leftmost column.\n\nSo, the result of A79A + 6A1A in base-11 is 17679. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{17679}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n```\n  A426\n+ 5A18\n```\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 6 + 8 = E (since A + 4 = E in base-11)\n2. 2 + 1 = 3\n3. 4 + A = 13 (since 4 + 7 = 11, and we carry over 1)\n4. 1 (carry over) + A + 5 = 15 (since 1 + 7 + 5 = 13, and we carry over 1)\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n```\n  1\n  A426\n+ 5A18\n-------\n  153E\n```\n\nTherefore, the sum of A426 and 5A18 in base-11 is \\boxed{153E}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + 5 = 12 (in base-10), which is equal to 10 + 2 = A2 (in base-11). So, we write down the 2 and carry over the 1 (or A0 in base-11).\n\nNext, we add the second rightmost digits and the carry-over:\n\n6 + 7 + 1 (carry-over) = 14 (in base-10), which is equal to 11 + 3 = A3 (in base-11). So, we write down the 3 and carry over the 1 (or A0 in base-11).\n\nNow, we add the third rightmost digits and the carry-over:\n\n0 + 3 + 1 (carry-over) = 4 (in base-10), which is equal to 4 (in base-11). So, we write down the 4.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost digits:\n\n4 + 6 = 10 (in base-10), which is equal to A (in base-11). So, we write down the A.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result:\n\n\\boxed{A432}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + A: Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 7 + 10 = 17 in base-10. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16 (1 * 11^1) + 6 (6 * 11^0), so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n0 + 0 + 1 (carry-over): This is just 1, so we write down 1.\n\n2 + 5: This is 7, so we write down 7.\n\nSo, the result is 7166 in base-11. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{7166}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A933 and 2A88 in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have 3 + 8. In base-11, 3 + 8 = 10, which is represented as "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. In the next column (elevens place), we have 1 (carried over) + 3 + 8. In base-11, 1 + 3 + 8 = 12, which is represented as "1A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n3. In the next column (121s place), we have 1 (carried over) + 9 + A. In base-11, 1 + 9 + A = 1 + 9 + 10 = 20, which is represented as "1A9". So, we write down "9" and carry over 2 to the next column.\n\n4. In the next column (1331s place), we have 2 (carried over) + A + 2. In base-11, 2 + A + 2 = 2 + 10 + 2 = 14, which is represented as "13". So, we write down "3" and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n5. Since there are no more digits in the original numbers, we just write down the carried over 1 in the next column (14641s place).\n\nSo, the sum of A933 and 2A88 in base-11 is 13A9A. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{13A9A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n2 + A (in base-11) is equivalent to 2 + 10 (in base-10), which is 12.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in each place value:\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost digit (the 1s place), we have 0 + 9. This sum is 9, so we write down a 9 in the 1s place of our result.\n\n2. Moving to the next digit (the 11s place), we have 0 + 8. This sum is 8, so we write down an 8 in the 11s place of our result.\n\n3. In the next digit (the 121s place), we have A + 6. Since A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, the sum is 10 + 6 = 16. However, since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down a 5 in the 121s place of our result.\n\n4. Finally, in the last digit (the 1331s place), we have 5 + 5, plus the 1 we carried over. This sum is 11, which is equivalent to 10 in base-10. Since we are working in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down a 0 in the 1331s place of our result. We also need to add an extra digit to represent the carried-over 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 1(14641) + 0(1331) + 5(121) + 8(11) + 9(1), which in base-11 is \\boxed{10589}.

First, let's break down the addition into columns:\n\n```\n  A852\n+ 8419\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we have 2 + 9. In base-11, 2 + 9 = 1(11^1) + 0 = 10. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n```\n  1\n  A852\n+ 8419\n------\n    0\n```\n\nNow, let's move to the next column. We have 1 (carry-over) + 5 + 1.

So, we write down 2 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n```\n  1\n  A852\n+ 8419\n------\n  270\n```\n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, we have 1 (carry-over) + A + 8. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, we have 1 + 10 + 8 = 19. In base-11, 19 = 1(11^1) + 8 = 18. So, we write down 18.\n\n```\n  A852\n+ 8419\n------\n 18270\n```\n\nTherefore, A852 + 8419 in base-11 is \\boxed{18270}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers to base-10 to make the calculations easier.\n\nA410 in base-11 is equal to (10 \xd7 11^2) + (4 \xd7 11^1) + (1 \xd7 11^0) = 1210 + 44 + 1 = 1255 in base-10.\n\n35A9 in base-11 is equal to (3 \xd7 11^3) + (5 \xd7 11^2) + (10 \xd7 11^1) + (9 \xd7 11^0) = 3993 + 605 + 110 + 9 = 4717 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 1255 + 4717 = 5972.\n\nNow we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 5972 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 5972 \xf7 11 = 542, remainder 10. Write down the remainder (A).\n\n2. Divide the quotient (542) by 11: 542 \xf7 11 = 49, remainder 3. Write down the remainder (3).\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (49) by 11: 49 \xf7 11 = 4, remainder 5. Write down the remainder (5).\n\n4. The last quotient (4) is less than 11, so we write it down as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 453A. Therefore, A410 + 35A9 = \\boxed{453A}.

Since 14 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 and write down 4 as the rightmost digit of the sum.\n\nNext, we have 1 (carry-over) + 7 + 5. In base-11, this is equivalent to 13 in base-10. Since 13 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 and write down 3 as the next digit of the sum.\n\nNow, we have 1 (carry-over) + A + 6. In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, we have 1 + 10 + 6, which is 17 in base-10. Since 17 is greater than 10, we carry over 1 and write down 7 as the next digit of the sum.\n\nFinally, we have 1 (carry-over) + 8. In base-11, this is equivalent to 9 in base-10. We don't need to carry over this time, so we write down 9 as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum A718 + 8656 = 9374 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{9374}.

Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the extra value. In base-11, 16 is represented as 15 (1*11^1 + 5*11^0). So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 5.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit:\n\n1 (carried over) + 7 + 9 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16 (1*11^1 + 6*11^0).\n\nSo, the sum of 7702 and 9533 in base-11 is 16555.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{16555}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the units place (2 + 8)\n2 + 8 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nStep 2: Add the tens place (4 + 4) and the carry-over (1)\n4 + 4 + 1 = 9 in base-10, which is 9 in base-11. So, we write down 9.\n\nStep 3: Add the hundreds place (3 + 8)\n3 + 8 = 11 in base-10, which is 10 in base-11. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next place value.\n\nStep 4: Add the thousands place (3 + 3) and the carry-over (1)\n3 + 3 + 1 = 7 in base-10, which is 7 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6 and 2). In base-11, 6 + 2 = 8. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 8.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (3 and 8). In base-11, 3 + 8 = 11. Since 11 is equal to 10 in base-11, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (2, 3, and the carried-over 1). In base-11, 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. So, the next digit of the sum is 6.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (1 and 3). In base-11, 1 + 3 = 4.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Adding the rightmost digits (4 + 7)\n4 + 7 = B (11 in base-10)\n\nSince B is a single digit in base-11, we don't need to carry over any value.\n\nStep 2: Adding the next digits (0 + 6)\n0 + 6 = 6\n\nAgain, no need to carry over any value.\n\nStep 3: Adding the next digits (8 + 9)\n8 + 9 = 11 in base-10, which is 10 in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A983 and 3041 in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have 3 + 1, which is 4. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 4.\n\n2. Moving to the next column (elevens place), we have 8 + 4, which is 12 in base-10. Since we're working in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2. So, the second digit from the right is 2.\n\n3. In the next column (121s place), we have 9 + 0 + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). This is simply A in base-11. So, the third digit from the right is A.\n\n4. In the leftmost column (1331s place), we have A + 3. In base-10, A is equivalent to 10, so we have 10 + 3 = 13. Since 13 is greater than 11, we need to carry over 1 to an additional column on the left and write down 2. So, the fourth digit from the right is 2, and we have an additional digit, 1, on the left.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum A983 + 3041 = 12A24 in base-11. So, the result is \\boxed{12A24}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

In base-11, 15 is represented as 14 (1 * 11^1 + 4 * 11^0). So, we carry over the 1 and write down the 4.\n\nNow, let's put all the digits together: 1 (carried over), 4, 8, B, D.\n\nSo, 7437 + 8486 in base-11 is \\boxed{148BD}.

Since 10 is not a valid digit in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, we have 1 * 11^3 and 445 remaining.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient for 11^2:\n445 \xf7 121 = 3 with a remainder of 78. So, we have 3 * 11^2 and 78 remaining.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient for 11^1:\n78 \xf7 11 = 7 with a remainder of 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (2 and A). In base-11, A represents 10. So, 2 + 10 = 12. Since 12 is greater than 10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. The rightmost digit of the sum is 2 (12 - 11 * 1).\n\nStep 2: Add the second rightmost digits (2 and 7) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). So, 2 + 7 + 1 = 10. Since 10 is equal to 11 - 1, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. The second rightmost digit of the sum is A (10).\n\nStep 3: Add the third rightmost digits (A and 7) and the carry-over from the previous step (1). In base-11, A represents 10. So, 10 + 7 + 1 = 18.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A042+2242? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the numbers from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA042 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^3) + (0 * 11^2) + (4 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 13310 + 0 + 44 + 2 = 13356 in base-10.\n\n2242 in base-11 is equal to (2 * 11^3) + (2 * 11^2) + (4 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 2662 + 242 + 44 + 2 = 2950 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two numbers in base-10: 13356 + 2950 = 16306.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 16306 by 11^3 (1331) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 12 and the remainder is 294.\n2. Divide the remainder (294) by 11^2 (121) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 2 and the remainder is 52.\n3. Divide the remainder (52) by 11^1 (11) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 4 and the remainder is 8.\n4. The remainder (8) is the last digit.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 12A48. However, since we only have digits 0-9 and A in base-11, we need to carry over the 12 in the first position:\n\n12A48 = (1 * 11^4) + (2 * 11^3) + (10 * 11^2) + (4 * 11^1) + (8 * 11^0) = 14641 + 2662 + 1210 + 44 + 8 = 17565 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's convert 17565 back to base-11:\n\n1. Divide 17565 by 11^3 (1331) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 13 and the remainder is 193.\n2. Divide the remainder (193) by 11^2 (121) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 72.\n3. Divide the remainder (72) by 11^1 (11) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 6 and the remainder is 6.\n4. The remainder (6) is the last digit.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 13166.\n\nTherefore, A042 + 2242 in base-11 is \\boxed{13166}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nA (10 in base-10) + 6 = 16 in base-10, which is 15 in base-11 (since 16 - 1 = 15). So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carried over) + 8 + 8 = 17 in base-10, which is 16 in base-11 (since 17 - 1 = 16). So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n1 (carried over) + 4 + 5 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 0 (since there's no need to carry over anything).\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\n7 + 7 = 14 in base-10, which is 13 in base-11 (since 14 - 1 = 13). So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have to include the carried over 1 as the leftmost digit, so the final result is:\n\n1 3 A 6 5\n\nTherefore, 748A + 7586 in base-11 is \\boxed{13A65}.

First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nA (10 in base-10) + 3 = 13 in base-10, which is 12 in base-11 (1 remainder 2). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n6 + 7 + 1 (carry-over) = 14 in base-10, which is 13 in base-11 (1 remainder 3). So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n6 + 2 + 1 (carry-over) = 9 in base-10, which is 9 in base-11. So, we write down 9.\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\n5 + 3 = 8 in base-10, which is 8 in base-11. So, we write down 8.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{8932}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Units column: 1 + 2 = 3\n2. Tens column: 3 + 8 = B (since 11 in base-11 is represented by A, 12 is represented by 10, and 13 is represented by 11, so 11 + 2 = B)\n3. Hundreds column: 9 + 8 = 11, but since we are in base-11, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0.\n4.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers A2A7 and 2736 in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. In the rightmost column, we have 7 + 6. In base-10, this is 13. Since 13 in base-11 is represented as 10 (1*11^1 + 0*11^0), we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\n2. In the second column from the right, we have A (which is 10 in base-10) + 3 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 14. Since 14 in base-11 is represented as 11 (1*11^1 + 1*11^0), we write down a 1 and carry over a 1 to the next column.\n\n3. In the third column from the right, we have 2 + 7 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 10. Since 10 in base-11 is represented as A (A*11^0), we write down an A and carry over a 0 to the next column.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have A (which is 10 in base-10) + 2 + 0 (the carry-over). In base-10, this is 12. Since 12 in base-11 is represented as 10 (1*11^1 + 0*11^0), we write down a 0 and carry over a 1 to a new column on the left.\n\nSo, the result of A2A7 + 2736 in base-11 is 10A10.\n\n\\boxed{10A10}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n8 + 9 = 17 (in base-10), which is 16 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 6 * 11^0 = 17). So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's add the numbers in the next place value, along with the carry-over.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + 1 = 3 (in base-10), which is also 3 in base-11. So, we write down 3.\n\nNext, let's add the numbers in the next place value.\n\n3 + 1 = 4 (in base-10), which is also 4 in base-11. So, we write down 4.\n\nFinally, let's add the numbers in the last place value.\n\nThere is only one number, 1, so we write down 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{1436}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. 5 + 9 = 14 (in base-10), which is 13 in base-11. So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\n2. 1 (carry-over) + 2 + 3 = 6 (in base-10), which is 6 in base-11. So, we write down 6.\n\n3. 7 + 8 = 15 (in base-10), which is 14 in base-11. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n4. 1 (carry-over) + 7 + A = 1 + 7 + 10 = 18 (in base-10), which is 16 in base-11. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n5. 1 (carry-over) = 1 (in base-10), which is 1 in base-11. So, we write down 1.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 1, 6, 4, 6, 3.\n\nSo, 7725 + A839 in base-11 is \\boxed{16463}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nColumn 1 (ones place): 2 + A. Since A in base-11 represents 10 in base-10, we have 2 + 10 = 12. In base-11, 12 is represented as 10 + 1, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nColumn 2 (elevens place): 3 + 4 + 1 (carry-over) = 8. There is no need to carry over anything here.\n\nColumn 3 (121s place): 1 + 4 = 5. No carry-over needed.\n\nColumn 4 (1331s place): 7 + 3 = A.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the given numbers from base-11 to base-10.\n\nFor 2562 in base-11:\n2 * (11^2) + 5 * (11^1) + 6 * (11^0) = 2 * 121 + 5 * 11 + 6 * 1 = 242 + 55 + 6 = 303 in base-10.\n\nFor 5492 in base-11:\n5 * (11^2) + 4 * (11^1) + 9 * (11^0) = 5 * 121 + 4 * 11 + 9 * 1 = 605 + 44 + 9 = 658 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10:\n303 + 658 = 961.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 961 by 11 and find the remainder:\n   961 \xf7 11 = 87 with a remainder of 4.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (87) by 11 and find the remainder:\n   87 \xf7 11 = 7 with a remainder of 10 (which is A in base-11).\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (7) by 11 and find the remainder:\n   7 \xf7 11 = 0 with a remainder of 7.\n\nSince we have reached a quotient of 0, we can stop here.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Adding the rightmost digits, we have 6 + 7. Since 6 + 7 = 13 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the result. So far, we have:\n\n```\n  A606\n+ 4697\n------\n    3\n```\n\nStep 2: Adding the next digits, we have A + 9 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-11, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 in base-10. Since 20 in base-10 is equal to 1A in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down A as the next digit of the result. Now we have:\n\n```\n  A606\n+ 4697\n------\n   A3\n```\n\nStep 3: Adding the next digits, we have 6 + 6 + 1 (the carry-over).

Now we have:\n\n```\n  A606\n+ 4697\n------\n  3A3\n```\n\nStep 4: Finally, adding the leftmost digits, we have 1 (the carry-over) + 4. Since 1 + 4 = 5 in base-10, we write down 5 as the leftmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  A606\n+ 4697\n------\n 53A3\n```\n\nSo, A606 + 4697 in base-11 is equal to 53A3 in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{53A3}.

In base-11, A represents 10. So, 10 + 5 = 15. Since we are in base-11, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the remainder, which is 4. So, the next digit of the sum is 4, and we carry over 1.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (6 and 6) and the carry-over (1). In base-11, 6 + 6 + 1 = 13. Since we are in base-11, we need to write down the remainder, which is 2, and carry over the 1.\n\nStep 5: Write down the carry-over from the previous step as the leftmost digit of the sum.

So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost digit:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + 9 = 11 (in base-10), which is equal to 10 in base-11. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have a carry-over of 1 left, so we write it down as the leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the sum of 16A9 and 9469 in base-11 is \\boxed{10643}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. 8 + 5 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Now, we add the second digits: A (which is 10 in base-10) + 3 + the carry-over 1. This gives us 10 + 3 + 1 = 14 in base-10. Since 14 = 1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Finally, we add the leftmost digits: 3 + 5 + the carry-over 1. This gives us 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 in base-10, which is just 9 in base-11.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 932 in base-11.\n\nSo, the sum of 30A8 and 53A5 in base-11 is \\boxed{932}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers digit by digit from right to left, carrying over when necessary.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost digit, we have 1 + 6. In base-11, this is simply 7. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 7.\n\n2. Moving to the next digit, we have 4 + 2. In base-11, this is 6. So, the second digit from the right is 6.\n\n3. For the third digit, we have 9 + 1. In base-11, this is A. So, the third digit from the right is A.\n\n4. Finally, for the leftmost digit, we have A + 6. In base-11, this is 10 + 6 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 10, we need to carry over. 16 in base-11 is represented as 15 (1*11^1 + 5*11^0). So, we carry over the 1 and have 5 as the leftmost digit.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum A941 + 6126 = 15A67 in base-11.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{15A67}.

So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 4: Adding the fourth column from the right (thousands place) and the carry-over\n8 + A + 1 = 8 + 10 + 1 = 19 (base-11)\nSince 19 is greater than the base, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 5: Write down the carry-over as the leftmost digit\n1\n\nSo, the sum of 8454 and AA32 in base-11 is 19846.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{19846}.

Second column from the right: 7 + 1 + 1 (carry-over) = 9. There is no carry-over in this case.\n\n3. Third column from the right: 9 + 8 = 17. In base-11, 17 is represented as 16 with a carry-over of 1. So, we write down 6 and carry-over 1.\n\n4. Leftmost column: 1 (carry-over) = 1.\n\nNow, let's put the numbers together: 1, 6, 9, 3.\n\nSo, 9774 + 811A in base-11 is \\boxed{1693}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nA (10 in base-10) + A (10 in base-10) = 14 in base-10, which is 13 in base-11 (since 14 - 11 = 3). So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 + 9 + 1 (carry-over) = 11 in base-10, which is 10 in base-11. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n8 + 8 + 1 (carry-over) = 17 in base-10, which is 16 in base-11 (since 17 - 11 = 6). So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\n3 + A (10 in base-10) + 1 (carry-over) = 14 in base-10, which is 13 in base-11 (since 14 - 11 = 3). So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nSince we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left.\n\nSo, the final result is:\n\n1 (carry-over) 3 6 0 3\n\nThus, 3815 + A98A in base-11 is \\boxed{13603} in base-11.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the given numbers from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA192 in base-11 is equal to (10 * 11^2) + (1 * 11^1) + (2 * 11^0) = 1331 + 11 + 2 = 1344 in base-10.\n\n6474 in base-11 is equal to (6 * 11^3) + (4 * 11^2) + (7 * 11^1) + (4 * 11^0) = 6 * 1331 + 4 * 121 + 7 * 11 + 4 = 7986 + 484 + 77 + 4 = 8551 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add the two base-10 numbers: 1344 + 8551 = 9895.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 9895 by 11^3 (1331) and find the quotient and remainder.\n   Quotient: 7 (since 7 * 1331 = 9317)\n   Remainder: 578 (since 9895 - 9317 = 578)\n\n2. Divide the remainder (578) by 11^2 (121) and find the quotient and remainder.\n   Quotient: 4 (since 4 * 121 = 484)\n   Remainder: 94 (since 578 - 484 = 94)\n\n3. Divide the remainder (94) by 11^1 (11) and find the quotient and remainder.\n   Quotient: 8 (since 8 * 11 = 88)\n   Remainder: 6 (since 94 - 88 = 6)\n\n4. The remainder (6) is less than 11^0 (1), so it becomes the last digit.\n\nSo, the result in base-11 is 7486.\n\nThus, A192 + 6474 in base-11 is equal to \\boxed{7486}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n6 + 2 = 8 (no carrying needed)\n\nNext, we move to the second column from the right:\n\n2 + 5 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\nNow, we move to the third column from the right:\n\n6 + 1 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost column:\n\n8 + 6 = E (since 14 in base-10 is E in base-11)\n\nSo, the sum of 8266 and 6152 in base-11 is E778.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{E778}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + 4 = 11, which is A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we have 5 + 5 + 1 (the carry-over) = 11, which is also A in base-11. We write down A and carry over 1 again.\n\nNow, we have 2 + 2 + 1 (the carry-over) = 5. We write down 5.\n\nFinally, we have 5 + nothing = 5. We write down 5.\n\nSo, the sum of 5257 and 2554 in base-11 is 5A5A. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{5A5A}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. The rightmost column is 3 + 7. In base-10, this is 10, but in base-11, it's written as "A". So, we write down "A" and carry over 1.\n\n2. The next column is 6 + 9, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 16. In base-11, we write 16 as "15" (since 1 * 11^1 + 5 * 11^0 = 16). So, we write down "5" and carry over 1.\n\n3. The next column is 2 + 2, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 5. In base-11, we write 5 as "5". So, we write down "5" and there's no carry-over.\n\n4. The leftmost column is 6 + 4. In base-10, this is 10. In base-11, we write 10 as "A". So, we write down "A".\n\nPutting it all together, we have A553. So, 6263 + 4297 in base-11 is \\boxed{A553}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is A6A9+4052? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers A6A9 and 4052 in base-11, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (units place), we have 9 + 2. In base-11, this is the same as in base-10, so we get 11. Since 11 is equal to 10 in base-11, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\n2. Moving to the next column (11s place), we have A (which is 10 in base-10) + 5 + the carry-over 1. This gives us 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 in base-10. In base-11, 16 is represented as 15, so we write down a 5 and carry over a 1.\n\n3. In the next column (121s place), we have 6 + 0 + the carry-over 1. This is 6 + 1 = 7 in both base-10 and base-11, so we write down a 7 and don't need to carry over anything.\n\n4. Finally, in the leftmost column (1331s place), we have A (which is 10 in base-10) + 4. This gives us 10 + 4 = 14 in base-10. In base-11, 14 is represented as 13, so we write down a 3 and carry over a 1.\n\n5. Since we have a carry-over from the last column, we need to add one more digit to the left. So, we write down a 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result 1750 in base-11. So, the sum of A6A9 and 4052 in base-11 is \\boxed{1750}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n9 + 4 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 2 * 11^0 = 13). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\n1 (carry-over) + 7 + 6 = 14 in base-10, which is equal to 13 in base-11 (since 1 * 11^1 + 3 * 11^0 = 14). So, we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 1 + 0 = 2 in base-10, which is equal to 2 in base-11. So, we write down 2.\n\nFinally, we have the leftmost column:\n\n2 + nothing = 2 in base-10, which is equal to 2 in base-11. So, we write down 2.\n\nPutting all the columns together, we get the result: 2322.\n\nSo, 1769 + 2064 in base-11 is \\boxed{2322}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's convert the given numbers from base-11 to base-10.\n\nA360 in base-11 means (10 * 11^2) + (3 * 11^1) + (6 * 11^0) = 1210 + 33 + 6 = 1249 in base-10.\n\nA369 in base-11 means (10 * 11^2) + (3 * 11^1) + (9 * 11^0) = 1210 + 33 + 9 = 1252 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's add these two numbers in base-10: 1249 + 1252 = 2501.\n\nNow, we need to convert the result back to base-11. To do this, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. Divide 2501 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder: 2501 \xf7 11 = 227 with a remainder of 4.\n2. Divide the quotient (227) by 11 and find the new quotient and remainder: 227 \xf7 11 = 20 with a remainder of 7.\n3. Divide the new quotient (20) by 11 and find the final quotient and remainder: 20 \xf7 11 = 1 with a remainder of 9.\n\nNow, we'll use the remainders to construct the base-11 number: 974.\n\nSo, A360 + A369 in base-11 is \\boxed{974}.

However, since we are in base-11, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 (15 - 11 = 4).

The quotient is 1 (since 1 * 1331 = 1331) and the remainder is 497.\n\n3. Divide the remainder 497 by 11^2 (which is 121) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 4 (since 4 * 121 = 484) and the remainder is 13.\n\n4. Divide the remainder 13 by 11^1 (which is 11) and find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 1 (since 1 * 11 = 11) and the remainder is 2.\n\n5. The remainder 2 is less than 11, so it is the last digit in the base-11 representation.\n\nPutting all the quotients together, we get the base-11 representation of the result: A1412.\n\nSo, A2A2 + 1120 in base-11 is \\boxed{A1412}.

Finally, we have a remainder of 7, which is our last digit:\n\n11^0 = 1 (fits 7 times)\n\nSo, our final number in base-11 is:\n\n\\boxed{5897}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 2193+1464? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers in base-11 column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 + 4 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\n9 + 6 = 15, which is equal to 1A in base-11 (carry over 1)\n\n1 (carried) + 2 + 4 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\n1 + 1 = 2 (no carrying needed)\n\nSo, the sum of 2193 and 1464 in base-11 is 2747. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{2747}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-11 where the digits are "0123456789A", what is 2890+12A3? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. A (10 in base-10) + 3 = 13 in base-10, which is equal to 12 in base-11. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2. 1 (carried over) + 9 + 2 = 12 in base-10, which is equal to 11 in base-11. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\n3. 1 (carried over) + 8 + 1 = 10 in base-10, which is equal to A in base-11. So, we write down A and carry over 0.\n\n4. 2 + 0 = 2 in base-11. So, we write down 2.\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 2A12.\n\nSo, 2890 + 12A3 in base-11 is \\boxed{2A12}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
