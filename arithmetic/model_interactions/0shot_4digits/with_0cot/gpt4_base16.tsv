You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is ECD1+5FC9? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n1. Adding the first digits: 1 + 9 = 1A (since 9 + 1 = 10 in base-10, which is A in base-16)\n2. Adding the second digits with carry: C + C + 1 (carry from the previous step) = 19 (since C + C = 18 in base-10, which is 12 in base-16, and 12 + 1 = 19 in base-10)\n3. Adding the third digits with carry: E + F + 1 (carry from the previous step) = 1E (since E + F = 29 in base-10, which is 1D in base-16, and 1D + 1 = 1E in base-16)\n4. Adding the fourth digits: There are no carries from the previous step, so we just add the digits: 5 + 0 = 5\n\nNow, let's put the digits together: 5, 1E, 9, 1A\n\nSo, ECD1 + 5FC9 = \\boxed{51E91A}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add A8EF and BB2A in base-16, we'll proceed column by column, just like in base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15 (since base-16 has 16 digits).\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column (ones place): F + A. Since F is 15 and A is 10, their sum is 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0 = 19. So, we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Move to the next column (16s place): E + 2 + 1 (carry-over). E is 14, so the sum is 14 + 2 + 1 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 11. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Move to the next column (256s place): 8 + B + 1 (carry-over). B is 11, so the sum is 8 + 11 + 1 = 20. In base-16, 20 is represented as 1*16^1 + 4*16^0 = 14. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n4. Move to the last column (4096s place): A + B + 1 (carry-over). A is 10 and B is 11, so the sum is 10 + 11 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 1*16^1 + 6*16^0 = 16. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nSince there is a carry-over in the last column, we write down 1 in the next place (65536s place).\n\nSo, the final result is 16419 in base-16.\n\n\\boxed{16419}	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the numbers A3FA and E670 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: A (10) + 0 = A. So, the rightmost digit of the result is A.\n\n2. Add the next digits: F (15) + 7 = 1C (28). Write down C and carry over the 1.\n\n3. Add the next digits along with the carry-over: 3 + 6 + 1 = A (10). So, the next digit of the result is A.\n\n4. Add the leftmost digits: A (10) + E (14) = 18 (24). Write down 18.\n\nPutting it all together, the result is 18AAC.\n\nSo, the sum of A3FA and E670 in base-16 is \\boxed{18AAC}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the two numbers C837 and 65AD in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 7 + D. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 7 + 13 = 20 in base-10. Converting 20 back to base-16, we get 14, which is represented as E. So, we write down E and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Add the next digits, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 3 + A. A is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 1 + 3 + 10 = 14 in base-10. Converting 14 back to base-16, we get E again. So, we write down E and carry over the 1.\n\n3. Add the next digits, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + 8 + 5. In base-10, this is 1 + 8 + 5 = 14. Converting 14 back to base-16, we get E once more. So, we write down E and carry over the 1.\n\n4. Add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + C + 6. C is equivalent to 12 in base-10, so we have 1 + 12 + 6 = 19 in base-10. Converting 19 back to base-16, we get 13, which is represented as D.\n\nPutting all the results together, we have DEEE as the sum of C837 and 65AD in base-16.\n\nSo, C837 + 65AD = \\boxed{DEEE}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers A6A5 and 47EC in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 5 + C. In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So, 5 + 12 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 1 * 16^0 = 11. So, we write down 1 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\n2. In the next column, we have A + 7 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 2 * 16^0 = 12. So, we write down 2 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\n3. In the next column, we have 6 + E + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, E is equivalent to 14 in base-10. So, 6 + 14 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0 = 15. So, we write down 5 and carry over the other 1 to the next column.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have A + 4 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 4 + 1 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented as F.\n\nSo, the sum of A6A5 and 47EC in base-16 is F521.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{F521}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 5 + 1 = 6\n2. 8 + 0 = 8\n3. 2 + F (which is 15 in base-10) = 2 + 15 = 17. Since we are in base-16, we carry over 1 and write down 1 (which is the same in base-16).\n4. 8 + 8 + 1 (carry-over) = 17. Again, we carry over 1 and write down 1.\n\nSo, the result is 11816.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n1. 3 + 9 = 12 (in base-10), which is C in base-16. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\n2. 0 + 6 = 6 (in base-10), but we have a carry-over of 1, so it becomes 6 + 1 = 7 (in base-10). We write down 7 and there is no carry-over this time.\n\n3. 4 + 3 = 7 (in base-10). We write down 7.\n\n4. There is no digit in the thousands place for either number, so we don't need to add anything here.\n\nSo, the final result is 773C. Therefore, 4003 + 4369 = \\boxed{773C}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nF + 0 = F\n\nF + 7 = 16, which is 10 in base-16.

Adding the rightmost digits: 1 + 4 = 5.\n2. Adding the next digits: A (10 in base-10) + 8 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 (18 - 16).\n3. Adding the next digits with the carry-over: 6 + 9 + 1 (carry-over) = 16. Since 16 is equal to the base, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 0.\n4. Since there are no more digits in the leftmost column, we just write down the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, the sum of 6AA1 and 9484 in base-16 is \\boxed{10225}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down B and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\nC (12 in base 10) + 1 (from the carry over) + 1 = 14 in base 10, which is E in base 16. So, we write down E.\n\nNext column:\n\nE (14 in base 10) + 2 = 16 in base 10, which is 10 in base 16. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n1 (from the carry over) = 1 in base 16.

E + 2: Since E in base-16 is equivalent to 14 in base-10, we have 14 + 2 = 16. Since 16 is the base, we carry over 1 and write down 0 in the rightmost column.\n\n2. 1 (carried over) + B + 1: B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, so we have 1 + 11 + 1 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D, so we write down D in the next column.\n\n3. 4 + 9: In base-10, this is 4 + 9 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D, so we write down D in the next column.\n\n4. D + C: D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, and C in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So we have 13 + 12 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented by the digits 1 and 9 (since 1 * 16^1 + 9 * 16^0 = 25), so we write down 9 in the next column and carry over 1.\n\n5. 1 (carried over): Since there are no more digits to add, we simply write down the carried over 1 in the leftmost column.\n\nSo, the sum of D4EB and 9C12 in base-16 is 1D9D0.

So, the third digit from the right in the sum is 0, and we have a carry of 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column (4096s place), we have D + B + 1 (carry). In base-16, D represents 13 and B represents 11, so we have 13 + 11 + 1 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 19. So, the leftmost digits in the sum are 19.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum DC15 + B479 = 1980E in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{1980E}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add B94C and D936 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: C + 6. Since C is 12 in base-10 and 6 is 6, their sum is 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down a 2 and carry over the 1.\n\n2.

Since 19 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over 1 to the next digit. 19 in base-16 is written as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next digit. We have 0 + 0 + 1 (the carry-over) = 1.\n\nFor the next digit, we have C + 3. In base-16, C is equivalent to 12 in base-10. So, we have 12 + 3 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the letter F.\n\nFinally, for the leftmost digit, we have B + 1. In base-16, B is equivalent to 11 in base-10. So, we have 11 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the letter C.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{CF13}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\n2. Adding the next digits: C + 2 + 1 (carry-over)\n   In base-10, C is equivalent to 12. So, we have 12 + 2 + 1 = 15.\n   In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, we write down F.\n\n3. Adding the next digits: 4 + 4\n   We have 4 + 4 = 8.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nA + D = 10 + 13 = 23 (in base-10). Since 23 in base-10 is equal to 17 in base-16, we write down the digit 7 and carry over the 1.\n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, including the carry-over:\n\n4 + 6 + 1 (carry-over) = 11 (in base-10).

Since 15 is F in base-16, we write down F and there is no carry-over.\n\nNext column:\n\nB + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12 (in base-10). Since 12 is C in base-16, we write down C.\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\nF = F (since there is no other digit to add).\n\nSo, B19C + F15B = FC7F.\n\nThus, the result is \\boxed{FC7F}.

However, we also need to carry over 1 to the next column since 14 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16).\n\n1 + 3 + 8 = C (since 1 is 1, 3 is 3, and 8 is 8, their sum is 12, which is C in base-16)\n\nSo, the result of 3C0A + 8FF2 is \\boxed{CEFC}.

To add the two numbers A4C5 and FE1C, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 5 + C.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nF + B = 15 + 11 = 26 (in base 10). Since 26 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is (26 - 16) = A.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + 5 = 1 + 9 + 5 = 15 (in base 10). Since 15 is the largest digit in base-16, there is no need to carry over. So, the second digit from the right is F.\n\nMoving to the next column:\n\nA + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 (in base 10). Since 16 is equal to 10 in base-16, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, the third digit from the right is 0.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + F + B = 1 + 15 + 11 = 27 (in base 10). Since 27 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to an additional column. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is (27 - 16) = B.\n\nNow, let's include the carry-over digit:\n\n1 (carry-over) = 1.\n\nSo, the sum of F9AF and B65B in base-16 is:\n\n\\boxed{1B0FA}.

So, we write down D and carry over 0.\n\n1 + 2 = 3 (in base-10), which is 3 in base-16. So, we write down 3 and carry over 0.\n\nB + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17 (in base-10), which is 11 in base-16. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\n1 (carry-over) + F + 7 = 1 + 15 + 7 = 23 (in base-10), which is 17 in base-16. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n1 (carry-over) = 1 (in base-10), which is 1 in base-16.

To add the two numbers AD60 and B4F9 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column (ones place), we have 0 + 9. This is simply 9, so we write down 9 and carry over 0.\n\n2. Moving to the next column (16s place), we have 6 + F. In base-16, F is equivalent to 15 in base-10. So, we have 6 + 15 = 21. Since we're in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 (16\xb9) and write down the remainder, which is 5.\n\n3. In the next column (256s place), we have D + 4, plus the 1 we carried over. In base-16, D is equivalent to 13 in base-10. So, we have 13 + 4 + 1 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, which is C. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\n4. Finally, in the leftmost column (4096s place), we have A + B, plus the 1 we carried over. In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 and B is equivalent to 11. So, we have 10 + 11 + 1 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16\xb9) + 6, or 16.\n\nSo, the sum of AD60 and B4F9 in base-16 is 16C59. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{16C59}.

So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have B + C + 1 (the carry-over). B + C = 17, and 17 + 1 = 18, which is 12 in base-16. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, we have A + 1 (the carry-over). A + 1 = 11, which is B in base-16.\n\nSo, the sum is B2A2.\n\nTherefore, AB92 + C070 = \\boxed{B2A2}.

To add the numbers AB4E and 53E8 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column (ones place): E + 8. Since E is 14 in base-10 and 8 is 8, we have 14 + 8 = 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1(16^1) + 6(16^0), so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Move to the next column (16s place): 4 + 3 + 1 (carry-over). In base-10, this is 4 + 3 + 1 = 8. There's no need to carry over, so we write down 8.\n\n3. Move to the next column (256s place): B + 5. Since B is 11 in base-10 and 5 is 5, we have 11 + 5 = 16. In base-16, 16 is represented as 1(16^2) + 0(16^1), so we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\n4. Move to the next column (4096s place): A + 1 (carry-over). Since A is 10 in base-10, we have 10 + 1 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented as B, so we write down B.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the sum: B806.\n\nSo, AB4E + 53E8 in base-16 is \\boxed{B806}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add F214 and 6F2F in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 4 + F\nSince F is equivalent to 15 in base-10, we have 4 + 15 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented as 13, so we write down 3 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Add the next digits, including the carry-over: 1 + 1 + 2\nThis gives us 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. There's no need to carry over anything this time.\n\n3. Add the next digits: F + 6\nIn base-10, this is 15 + 6 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 15, so we write down 5 and carry over the 1.\n\n4. Add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: 1 + 6\nThis gives us 1 + 6 = 7. There's no need to carry over anything this time.\n\nSo, the final result is 7533 in base-16.

To add the numbers DCFD and 9274 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have D + 4. In base-16, D represents 13, so 13 + 4 = 17.

Moving to the next column, we have C + 7, plus the carry-over 1. In base-16, C represents 12, so 12 + 7 + 1 = 20. Since 20 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 20 in base-16 is written as 14, so we write down 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n3. In the next column, we have F + 2, plus the carry-over 1. In base-16, F represents 15, so 15 + 2 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is written as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over the 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have 9 + D, plus the carry-over 1. In base-16, D represents 13, so 9 + 13 + 1 = 23. Since 23 is less than the next power of 16 (which is 256), we don't need to carry over. 23 in base-16 is written as 17.\n\nSo, the final result is 17241.

No need to carry over, so we write down E (14 in base-16) in the second column from the right.\n\nNext column:\nF + E = 15 + 14 = 29.

Now, let's add the second column: 8 + F + the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 8 + 15 + 1 = 24. Again, 24 is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 24 in base-16 is 18. We write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\n3. For the third column, we have 3 + 9 + the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 3 + 9 + 1 = 13. This time, we don't need to carry over since 13 is less than 15.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers B63B and 88B9 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. First column (ones place): B + 9\nB in base-16 is 11 in base-10, and 9 is the same in both bases. So, 11 + 9 = 20 in base-10. Since 20 in base-16 is 14, we write down 4 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Second column (16s place): 6 + B + 1 (carry-over)\n6 in base-16 is 6 in base-10, B is 11 in base-10, and the carry-over is 1. So, 6 + 11 + 1 = 18 in base-10. Since 18 in base-16 is 12, we write down 2 and carry over the 1.\n\n3. Third column (256s place): 3 + 8 + 1 (carry-over)\n3 in base-16 is 3 in base-10, 8 is the same in both bases, and the carry-over is 1. So, 3 + 8 + 1 = 12 in base-10. Since 12 in base-16 is C, we write down C and carry over the 0 (no carry-over in this case).\n\n4. Fourth column (4096s place): B + 8\nB in base-16 is 11 in base-10, and 8 is the same in both bases. So, 11 + 8 = 19 in base-10. Since 19 in base-16 is 13, we write down 13.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the sum: 13C24.\n\nSo, B63B + 88B9 = \\boxed{13C24}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n2 + 3 = 5\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n9 + C = 9 + 12 (since C is equivalent to 12 in base-10) = 21\n\nSince 21 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 21 in base-16 is 15 + 6, which is F + 6. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column, and don't forget the carry-over:\n\n4 + 3 + 1 (carry-over) = 8\n\nSo, the result is 865. Therefore, the sum of 49C2 and 3C33 in base-16 is:\n\n\\boxed{865}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nColumn 1 (ones place): 4 + 5 = 9\n\nColumn 2 (16s place): E (which is 14 in base-10) + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20. Since we're in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 and write down 4 (20 in base-10 is 14 in base-16).\n\nColumn 3 (256s place): 9 + 7 + 1 (carried over) = 17. Again, we need to carry over the 1 and write down 1 (17 in base-10 is 11 in base-16).\n\nColumn 4 (4096s place): There are no digits in this place for both numbers, so we just write down the 1 that was carried over.\n\nSo, the sum is 1149 in base-16. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{1149}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\nE + B = 14 + 11 = 25 (in base-10). Since 25 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. So, we write down 9 (25 - 16) and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 8 + 1 = 10 (in base-10). Since 10 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, we write down A (10 in base-16).\n\nNext column:\n\n2 + C = 2 + 12 = 14 (in base-10). Since 14 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, we write down E (14 in base-16).\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\nC + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18 (in base-10). Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. So, we write down 2 (18 - 16) and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have the carry-over 1 at the leftmost position. So, the final result is 1E2A9.\n\nTherefore, C28E + 6C1B = \\boxed{1E2A9}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is A2B3+2F71? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the two numbers A2B3 and 2F71 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 3 + 1. This is equal to 4, so we write down 4 and carry over 0.\n\n2. Moving to the next column, we have B + 7. In base-16, B is equivalent to 11 in base-10. So, we have 11 + 7 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over 1. To find the digit to write down, we subtract 16 from 18, which gives us 2. So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n3. In the next column, we have 2 + F + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, F is equivalent to 15 in base-10. So, we have 2 + 15 + 1 = 18. Again, we need to carry over 1 and write down 2 (18 - 16).\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have A + 2 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, we have 10 + 2 + 1 = 13. In base-16, 13 is represented by the digit D.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: \\boxed{D224}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\nF (15 in base 10) + 7 = 1C (28 in base 10)\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n5 + 0 + 1 (carried over from the previous column) = 6\n\nNext column:\n\n3 + B (11 in base 10) = E (14 in base 10)\n\nAnd finally, the leftmost column:\n\n4 + 7 = B (11 in base 10)\n\nSo, the sum of 435F and B707 in base-16 is:\n\n\\boxed{BE6C}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n5 + 3 = 8 (no carrying needed)\n\nNext column:\n\n4 + 8 = C (since 4 + 8 = 12 in base-10, and 12 is represented by C in base-16)\n\nNext column:\n\n4 + 3 = 7 (no carrying needed)\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\n3 + 2 = 5 (no carrying needed)\n\nSo, the sum of 3445 and 2383 in base-16 is 57C8.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{57C8}.

To add the two numbers 1BA8 and BDC0 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 8 + 0 = 8.\n2. Moving to the next column, we have A + C. In base-16, A represents 10 and C represents 12, so 10 + 12 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n3. In the next column, we have 1 (carried over) + B + D. In base-16, B represents 11 and D represents 13, so 1 + 11 + 13 = 25. Since 25 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 25 in base-16 is 1 * 16 + 9, so we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n4. In the leftmost column, we have 1 (carried over) + 1 = 2.\n\nPutting all the results together, we get the sum 1BA8 + BDC0 = 2968 in base-16.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{2968}.

Adding the rightmost digits: 3 + 8 = B (11 in base-10)\n2. Adding the next digits: 9 + 7 = 10 (16 in base-10), so we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n3. Adding the next digits along with the carry-over: 6 + 8 + 1 = F (15 in base-10)\n4. Adding the next digits: F + nothing = F (15 in base-10)\n5. Since there are no more digits in the second number, we just write down the remaining digits of the first number.\n\nSo, F693 + 8878 = \\boxed{F0FB}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. 9 + 6 = 15, which is F in base-16. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\n2. Now, we add the second column: 1 (carry-over) + E + E = 1 + 14 + 14 = 29. In base-16, 29 is 1D. So, we write down D and carry over 1.\n\n3. Next, we add the third column: 1 (carry-over) + B + 9 = 1 + 11 + 9 = 21. In base-16, 21 is 15. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n4.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers A24C and EB9B in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column: C + B. In base-16, C is 12 and B is 11. So, 12 + 11 = 23. Since 23 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 23 in base-16 is 17, so we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Move to the next column: 4 + 9 + 1 (carry over). In base-16, 4 is 4 and 9 is 9. So, 4 + 9 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. 14 in base-16 is E, so we write down E.\n\n3. Move to the next column: 2 + B. In base-16, 2 is 2 and B is 11. So, 2 + 11 = 13. Since 13 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. 13 in base-16 is D, so we write down D.\n\n4. Move to the last column: A + E. In base-16, A is 10 and E is 14. So, 10 + 14 = 24. Since 24 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 24 in base-16 is 18, so we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\n5. Since we have a carry over of 1, we need to add it as a new leftmost digit.\n\nSo, the final result is 18ED7. Therefore, A24C + EB9B = \\boxed{18ED7}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add the two numbers B3F4 and B8A6, we will perform the addition column by column, starting from the rightmost digit and moving to the leftmost digit.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\nA + A = 14 (in base-10), which is E in base-16. So, we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n7 + 3 = 10 (in base-10), which is A in base-16. But we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we need to add 1 as well:\n\nA + 1 = B in base-16. So, we write down B.\n\nNext column:\n\nD + D = 26 (in base-10), which is 1A in base-16. So, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, the leftmost column:\n\n6 + F = 21 (in base-10), which is 15 in base-16. But we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we need to add 1 as well:\n\n15 + 1 = 16 in base-16, which is written as 10.\n\nSo, the final result is 10ABE.\n\nTherefore, 6D7A + FD3A = \\boxed{10ABE}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n9 + B = 9 + 11 = 20 (in base 10). Since 20 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 20 in base-16 is 14, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's move to the next column:\n\nF + C + 1 (carry over) = 15 + 12 + 1 = 28 (in base 10). Again, this is greater than 15, so we need to carry over. 28 in base-16 is 1C, so we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n2 + 4 + 1 (carry over) = 7. This is less than 15, so we don't need to carry over.\n\nSo, the final result is 7C4. Therefore, 2FF9 + 4C1B = \\boxed{7C4}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n8 + 4 = 12 in base-10, which is C in base-16. So, we write down C and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we have 2 + 5, which is 7 in base-10. Since we carried over 1 from the previous step, we need to add that as well: 7 + 1 = 8 in base-10. So, we write down 8.\n\nNow, we have 5 + 0, which is 5 in base-10. So, we write down 5.\n\nFinally, we have 6 + 8, which is 14 in base-10. This is E in base-16. So, we write down E.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum: E58C.\n\nSo, 6528 + 8054 in base-16 is \\boxed{E58C}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the two numbers CAE2 and DC8E in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 2 + E. In base-16, E represents 14 in base-10. So, 2 + 14 = 16. Since 16 is the base, we write down a 0 and carry over a 1.\n\n2. In the next column, we have E + 8, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, E is 14, so we have 14 + 8 + 1 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17, so we write down a 7 and carry over a 1.\n\n3. In the third column, we have A + C, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, A is 10 and C is 12, so we have 10 + 12 + 1 = 23. In base-16, 23 is represented as 17, so we write down a 7 and carry over a 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have C + D, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, C is 12 and D is 13, so we have 12 + 13 + 1 = 26. In base-16, 26 is represented as 1A, so we write down A and carry over a 1.\n\n5. Since we have a carry-over 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final result is 1A770.\n\nTherefore, CAE2 + DC8E in base-16 is \\boxed{1A770}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Since we are in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 (16) and write down the remainder, which is A (10 in base-10).\n\n1 (carried over) + 5 + D (which is 13 in base-10) = 1 + 5 + 13 = 19. Again, since we are in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 (16) and write down the remainder, which is 3.\n\n1 (carried over) + 0 + 0 = 1\n\nSo, the result is 13A4.

To add the two numbers 1A4D and D095, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. D (13) + 5 = 12 (18 in base-10), so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n2. 1 (from the carry-over) + A (10) + 9 = 1A (26 in base-10), so we write down A and carry over 1.\n3. 1 (from the carry-over) + 1 + 0 = 2, so we write down 2.\n4. There's nothing to carry over, so we just write down the leftmost digit, which is D.\n\nSo, 1A4D + D095 = \\boxed{D2A2}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 3 + A = 1 + 3 + 10 = 14 (base-10), which is E in base-16. So, we write down E and carry over 0 (since 14 is less than 16).\n\nLast column:\n\n0 (carry-over) + C + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 (base-10), which is 11 in base-16.

So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F, and we carry over 1 to the next column.\n\n2. The next column is 2 + 9, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 2 + 9 + 1 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented by the digit C. So, the second digit from the right in the sum is C, and we don't need to carry over any value to the next column.\n\n3. The next column is 7 + 1. In base-10, this is 7 + 1 = 8. So, the third digit from the right in the sum is 8, and we don't need to carry over any value to the next column.\n\n4.

To add the two numbers EB0E and E5B9 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have E + 9. In base-16, E is 14 and 9 is 9, so 14 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 23 in base-16 is 17, so we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Moving to the next column, we have B + 5 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, B is 11 and 5 is 5, so 11 + 5 + 1 = 17.

In base-16, this is equivalent to 11 in base-10, which is represented as B. So, we write down B and carry over 1.\n\n2. In the second column, we have 1 (carry-over) + A + 9. In base-10, this is equivalent to 1 + 10 + 9 = 20, which is represented as 14 in base-16. So, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n3. In the third column, we have 1 (carry-over) + 7 + 2. In base-10, this is equivalent to 1 + 7 + 2 = 10, which is represented as A in base-16. So, we write down A and carry over 0.\n\n4. In the fourth column, we have 1 + B. In base-10, this is equivalent to 1 + 11 = 12, which is represented as C in base-16. So, we write down C and there is no carry-over.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the sum: C4AB.\n\nSo, 17A3 + B298 in base-16 is \\boxed{C4AB}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

To add F43B and 68B1 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column, just like in base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum exceeds 15 (since base-16 has 16 digits).\n\n1. Add the rightmost column: B + 1 = C (since B is 11 in base-10 and 1 is 1, their sum is 12, which is C in base-16).\n2. Add the next column: 3 + B = 3 + 11 = 14, which is E in base-16.\n3. Add the next column: 4 + 8 = 12, which is C in base-16. However, we need to carry over 1 to the next column since the sum exceeded 15.\n4. Add the leftmost column: F + 6 + 1 (carry over) = 15 + 6 + 1 = 22, which is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n5. Since we have a carry-over, the final result will have 5 digits. The leftmost digit will be the carry-over 1.\n\nSo, F43B + 68B1 = \\boxed{1C6EC} in base-16.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers in each place value, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nB + F = 11 + 15 = 26 (in base-10). Since 26 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next place value. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 6, and we carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next place value:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + 4 = 1 + 9 + 4 = 14 (in base-10). Since 14 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, the next digit of the sum is E (which is 14 in base-16).\n\nNext, let's move to the next place value:\n\n2 + 5 = 7 (in base-10). Since 7 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, the next digit of the sum is 7.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost place value:\n\nD + 0 = 13 (in base-10). Since 13 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over. So, the leftmost digit of the sum is D.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum 2D9B + 504F = \\boxed{DE76}.

So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nStep 4: Adding the next column (4096s place)\n6 + 7 = 13\nNow, we need to add the carry from the previous step, which is 1.\n13 + 1 = 14\nIn base-16, 14 is represented by the letter E.\n\nSo, the final result is E287.\n\nTherefore, 6762 + 7B25 = \\boxed{E287}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n2 + B (remember B is 11 in base-10):\n2 + 11 = 13, which is D in base-16. So, we write down D and carry over 1.\n\nNext column, 7 + 6:\n7 + 6 = 13, but we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we add 1:\n13 + 1 = 14, which is E in base-16. So, we write down E and carry over 1.\n\nNext column, 2 + 4:\n2 + 4 = 6, but we have a carry-over from the previous column, so we add 1:\n6 + 1 = 7. So, we write down 7.\n\nFinally, the leftmost column, 8 + 4:\n8 + 4 = 12, which is C in base-16.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the least significant digits (rightmost digits): F + A. Since F is 15 and A is 10 in base-10, we have 15 + 10 = 25. In base-16, 25 is represented as 1*16^1 + 9*16^0, which is 19. So, we write down 9 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, let's add the next digits along with the carry-over: 1 (carry-over) + F + 8. In base-10, this is 1 + 15 + 8 = 24.

In base-10, this is 1 + 1 + 7 = 9. In base-16, 9 is represented as 9*16^0, which is 9. So, we write down 9 and there is no carry-over.\n\nFinally, let's add the most significant digits: 1 + 7. In base-10, this is 1 + 7 = 8. In base-16, 8 is represented as 8*16^0, which is 8. So, we write down 8.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 8989.\n\nSo, 11FF + 78EA in base-16 is \\boxed{8989}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Adding the leftmost digits: A + F = 10 + 15 = 25 (which is 19 in base-16, so we write down 9 and carry over 1)\n\nSo, the result is 1C49. Therefore, A351 + 8FF8 = \\boxed{1C49}.

First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 + 6 = 9 (no carrying needed)\n\nNext, we move to the second rightmost digit:\n\n5 + C = 5 + 12 = 17. Since we are in base-16, we write down the digit 1 and carry over the 1.\n\nNow, we move to the third rightmost digit:\n\n9 + 8 + 1 (carried over) = 18.

Since we are working in base-16, we need to convert 27 to base-16. 27 in base-16 is 1B (1 * 16^1 + 11 * 16^0). So, we write down B and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column and don't forget the carry-over:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 + D = 1 + 2 + 13 = 16 (in base-10). Since we are working in base-16, 16 is equal to 10 (1 * 16^1 + 0 * 16^0).

B + D = 11 + 13 = 24 (in base-10). Since 24 in base-16 is 18, we write down 8 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Now, we add the second column: 1 (carry-over) + D + C = 1 + 13 + 12 = 26 (in base-10). Since 26 in base-16 is 1A, we write down A and carry over 1.\n\n3. For the third column: 1 (carry-over) + 5 + F = 1 + 5 + 15 = 21 (in base-10). Since 21 in base-16 is 15, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n4. Finally, for the fourth column: 1 (carry-over) + F = 1 + 15 = 16 (in base-10). Since 16 in base-16 is 10, we write down 1 and carry over 1.

To add the two numbers 2A0C and ED6D, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost column: C + D = 12 + 13 = 25. Since 25 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Add the next column, including the carry-over: A + 6 + 1 = 10 + 6 + 1 = 17. Again, this is greater than 15, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\n3. Add the next column, including the carry-over: 2 + E + 1 = 2 + 14 + 1 = 17. Once more, this is greater than 15, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\n4.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (3 and 2). In base-16, 3 + 2 = 5. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is 5.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits to the left (A and 9). In base-16, A represents 10 and 9 represents 9. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Since 19 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 19 in base-16 is 13, which is represented by the digit D. So, we write down D and carry over 1.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits to the left (4 and 1) along with the carry-over from the previous step. In base-16, 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. So, the next digit of the sum is 6.\n\nStep 4: Since there are no more digits to add, we have reached the final sum.\n\nSo, 4DA3 + 1692 = \\boxed{6DD5}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n6 + A: Since A in base-16 represents 10 in base-10, we have 6 + 10 = 16. Since we are in base-16, this is equal to 10 in base-16. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the next column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 2 + 7: In base-16, this is 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. We write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nNext column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + 3: In base-16, this is 1 + 9 + 3 = 13.

E (14 in base-10) + 9 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 15, we carry over 1 to the next column and write down 1 (17 - 16) as the rightmost digit.\n\n2. 1 (carry-over) + 9 + 4A (4 * 16 + 10 = 74 in base-10) = 75. Since 75 is greater than 15, we carry over 4 (75 // 16) and write down B (75 - 4 * 16) as the next digit.\n\n3. 4 (carry-over) + 1 + 4 = 9. There is no carry-over this time.\n\nSo, the result is 9B1.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n6 + B = 11 + 11 = 22 (in base-10), which is 16 + 6 = 1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0 = 16 + 6 = 22.

Since 31 in base-16 is F with a carry-over of 1, we write down F and carry-over 1.\n\nFinally, we move to the leftmost digit.\n\n1 (carry-over) + F = 1 + 15 = 16 (base 10). Since 16 in base-16 is 10, we write down 10.\n\nSo, the sum of FB66 and FB7F in base-16 is 1F71. Therefore, the result is \\boxed{1F71}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the two numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nE1DE\n+1A6A\n_____\n\nIn the rightmost column, we have E + A. Since E is 14 and A is 10 in base-10, their sum is 24.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the two numbers E50A and EF2C, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have A + C. Since A is 10 and C is 12 in base-10, their sum is 22. In base-16, 22 is represented as 16 + 6, which is 1 * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0, so the result is 16. We write down the 6 and carry over the 1.\n\n2. Moving to the next column, we have 5 + F + 1 (the carry-over). Since 5 is 5, F is 15, and 1 is 1 in base-10, their sum is 5 + 15 + 1 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented as 16 + 5, which is 1 * 16^1 + 5 * 16^0, so the result is 15. We write down the 5 and carry over the 1.\n\n3. In the next column, we have E + E + 1 (the carry-over). Since E is 14 in base-10, their sum is 14 + 14 + 1 = 29. In base-16, 29 is represented as 1 * 16^1 + D * 16^0, so the result is 1D. We write down the D and carry over the 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have 1 (the carry-over). Since there are no other digits to add, we simply write down the 1.\n\nSo, the final result is 1D56. Therefore, E50A + EF2C = \\boxed{1D56}.

To add the numbers A8A2 and 247F in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 2 + F. In base-16, F is equivalent to 15 in base-10. So, 2 + 15 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 15, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 1 (17 in base-16 is 11).\n\n2. In the next column, we have A + 7, plus the carry-over 1. In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 10 + 7 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we'll carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 (18 in base-16 is 12).\n\n3. In the next column, we have 8 + 4, plus the carry-over 1. In base-10, this is 8 + 4 + 1 = 13. Since 13 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over anything and can write down D (13 in base-16 is D).\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have 2 + A. In base-16, A is equivalent to 10 in base-10. So, 2 + 10 = 12. Since 12 is less than 16, we don't need to carry over anything and can write down C (12 in base-16 is C).\n\nPutting it all together, we have the sum: C2D1.\n\nSo, A8A2 + 247F = \\boxed{C2D1}.

Units column: 1 + 9 = A (since 1 + 9 = 10 in base-10, and 10 is represented as A in base-16)\n2. Tens column: 6 + F = 15 (since 6 + 15 = 21 in base-10, and 21 - 16 = 5, so we carry over 1)\n3. Hundreds column: 5 + B + 1 (carry-over) = 11 (since 5 + 11 + 1 = 17 in base-10, and 17 - 16 = 1, so we carry over 1)\n4. Thousands column: 4 + 6 + 1 (carry-over) = B (since 4 + 6 + 1 = 11 in base-10, and 11 is represented as B in base-16)\n\nSo, the sum of 4561 and 6BF9 in base-16 is BA1A.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{BA1A}.

To add the numbers 48E4 and D948 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 4 + 8.

In base-16, E represents 14, so we have 14 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is greater than 15 (the highest single-digit number in base-16), we need to carry over. 23 in base-16 is represented as 17 (since 23 - 16 = 7). So, we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have 4 + D + 1 (the carry-over from the previous step). In base-16, D represents 13, so we have 4 + 13 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 18 in base-16 is represented as 12 (since 18 - 16 = 2). So, we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n5.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\nColumn 1 (ones place): C + B\nC is equivalent to 12 in base-10, and B is equivalent to 11 in base-10.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add F513 and 4F2A in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 3 + A.

Add the next digits, plus the carry-over: 1 + 1 + F. Since F is 15 in base-10, 1 + 1 + F = 1 + 1 + 15 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented by the number 11 (1*16^1 + 1*16^0). So, we write down the rightmost digit, 1, and carry over the leftmost digit, 1.\n\n3. Add the next digits, plus the carry-over: 1 + 5 + 4. In base-10, this is 1 + 5 + 4 = 10.

Since F is 15 in base-10, 0 + F + 4 = 0 + 15 + 4 = 19. In base-16, 19 is represented by the number 13 (1*16^1 + 3*16^0). So, we write down the rightmost digit, 3, and carry over the leftmost digit, 1.\n\nNow, we have the digits 1, A, 1, and D from right to left, with a carry-over of 1.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add AE3C and EC9A in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Start with the rightmost column: C + A. In base-16, C is 12 and A is 10, so 12 + 10 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Move to the next column: 3 + 9 + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, 3 is 3 and 9 is 9, so 3 + 9 + 1 = 13. 13 in base-16 is D, so we write down D.\n\n3. Move to the next column: E + C. In base-16, E is 14 and C is 12, so 14 + 12 = 26. Since 26 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 26 in base-16 is 1 * 16 + 10, so we write down A and carry over 1.\n\n4. Move to the last column: A + E + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, A is 10 and E is 14, so 10 + 14 + 1 = 25. 25 in base-16 is 1 * 16 + 9, so we write down 9 and carry over 1.\n\n5. Since we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, the final result is 1 * 16^4 + 9 * 16^3 + A * 16^2 + D * 16^1 + 6 * 16^0 = 19AD6.\n\nThus, AE3C + EC9A = \\boxed{19AD6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nE + F = 14 + 15 = 29 (base-10). Since we are in base-16, we need to carry over the 1 and write down 9. So, we have:\n\n  8ACE\n+ 24FF\n------\n     9\n\nNow, let's move to the next column.\n\nC + 4 + 1 (carried over) = 12 + 4 + 1 = 17 (base-10). Again, we need to carry over the 1 and write down 1. So, we have:\n\n  8ACE\n+ 24FF\n------\n   19\n\nNext, let's move to the third column.\n\nA + 2 + 1 (carried over) = 10 + 2 + 1 = 13 (base-10). In base-16, 13 is represented by the letter D.

First, let's add the two numbers digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n7 + B: Since B in base-16 is equivalent to 11 in base-10, we have 7 + 11 = 18. In base-16, 18 is represented as 12, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n1 (carried over) + 1 + A: A in base-16 is equivalent to 10 in base-10, so we have 1 + 1 + 10 = 12. In base-16, 12 is represented as C, so we write down C and do not need to carry over any value.\n\nA + 9: 10 (A in base-10) + 9 = 19.

To add F284 and 670D in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have 4 + D. Since D is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 4 + 13 = 17. In base-16, 17 is represented as 1*16^1 + 1*16^0 = 11, so we write down 1 and carry over the 1.\n\n2.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\nC + 3 = F (since C in base-16 is 12 in base-10, and 12 + 3 = 15, which is F in base-16)\n\nNext, we move to the second column from the right:\n\nD + E = 13 + 14 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, let's move to the third column from the right:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + B = 1 + 9 + 11 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 15, we need to carry over 1 to the next column. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, let's move to the leftmost column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + A = 1 + 10 = 11, which is B in base-16.\n\nSo, the sum of 9ADC and BCE3 in base-16 is B51F.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{B51F}.

To add FCB1 and 15B5 in base-16, we'll proceed column by column, just like in base-10 addition, but carrying over when the sum is 16 or greater.\n\n1. Add the rightmost digits: 1 + 5 = 6. No carrying over is needed.\n2. Add the next digits: B + B = 11 + 11 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, so we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n3. Add the next digits, including the carry-over: C + 5 + 1 = 12 + 5 + 1 = 18. Since 18 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 18 in base-16 is 16 + 2, so we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n4. Add the leftmost digits, including the carry-over: F + 1 + 1 = 15 + 1 + 1 = 17. Since 17 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 17 in base-16 is 16 + 1, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, we have carried over 1 to a new leftmost position.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	To add the numbers FAFC and BCFA in base-16, we'll proceed column by column from right to left, just like in base-10 addition.\n\n1. Starting with the rightmost column, we have C + A. In base-16, A represents 10 and C represents 12. So, C + A = 12 + 10 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 15 (the highest single digit in base-16), we need to carry over. 22 in base-16 is 16 + 6, which can be written as 1*16^1 + 6*16^0, or simply 16 + 6. So, we write down 6 and carry over 1.\n\n2. Moving to the next column, we have F + F + 1 (the carry-over). In base-16, F represents 15. So, F + F + 1 = 15 + 15 + 1 = 31. Since 31 is greater than 15, we need to carry over again. 31 in base-16 is 1*16^1 + 15*16^0, or 16 + 15. So, we write down F and carry over 1.\n\n3. In the next column, we have A + C + 1. As we know, A represents 10 and C represents 12. So, A + C + 1 = 10 + 12 + 1 = 23. Since 23 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 23 in base-16 is 1*16^1 + 7*16^0, or 16 + 7. So, we write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have F + B + 1. In base-16, B represents 11. So, F + B + 1 = 15 + 11 + 1 = 27. Since 27 is greater than 15, we need to carry over. 27 in base-16 is 1*16^1 + 11*16^0, or 16 + 11. So, we write down B and carry over 1.\n\n5. Since we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left. So, we write down 1.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the result: 1B7F6.\n\nSo, FAFC + BCFA in base-16 is \\boxed{1B7F6}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\nB + 9 = 14 (in base-10), which is E in base-16.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is FB77+58DD? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the two numbers digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n7 + D = 7 + 13 = 20 (in base 10). Since 20 in base 10 is equal to 14 in base 16, we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNow let's move to the next digit:\n\n1 (carry) + B + 8 = 1 + 11 + 8 = 20 (in base 10). Again, 20 in base 10 is equal to 14 in base 16, so we write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\nNext digit:\n\n1 (carry) + 7 + 5 = 1 + 7 + 5 = 13 (in base 10). In base 16, 13 is represented by the digit D, so we write down D.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit:\n\nF + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20 (in base 10). In base 16, 20 is represented by 14, so we write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nSince we have a carry-over of 1, we need to add an extra digit to the left:\n\n1 (carry) = 1\n\nSo, the sum of FB77 and 58DD in base-16 is:\n\n\\boxed{14D44}.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\n0 + 6 = 6\n\n4 + F (which is 15 in base-10) = 4 + 15 = 19. Since we are in base-16, we carry over 1 and write down 3 (19 in base-16 is 13).\n\nNow, add the carried-over 1 to the next column:\n\n1 (carry-over) + 9 + 4 = 14. Since we are in base-16, we write down E (14 in base-16 is E) and there is no carry-over.\n\nFinally, add the remaining digits:\n\n5 + 4 = 9\n\nSo, the sum of 5940 and 44F6 in base-16 is \\boxed{9E36}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.\n\n1. The rightmost column: 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n2. The second column from the right: F + 1 = 10 (since F is 15 in base-10, F + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16, which is 10 in base-16). We carry over the 1.\n\n3. The third column from the right: 9 + F + 1 (carry-over) = 9 + 15 + 1 = 25 in base-10, which is 19 in base-16. We carry over the 1.\n\n4. The leftmost column: 1 (carry-over) + A = 1 + 10 = 11 in base-10, which is B in base-16.\n\nSo, the sum of 9FF1 and AF10 in base-16 is B191.\n\nTherefore, the result is \\boxed{B191}.

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-16 where the digits are "0123456789ABCDEF", what is C372+974D? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (2 and D). Since D in base-16 is equivalent to 13 in base-10, we have 2 + 13 = 15. In base-16, 15 is represented by the digit F. So, the rightmost digit of the sum is F, and there is no carry.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (7 and 4). We have 7 + 4 = 11. In base-16, 11 is represented by the digit B. So, the next digit of the sum is B, and there is no carry.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (3 and 7). We have 3 + 7 = 10. In base-16, 10 is represented by the digit A. So, the next digit of the sum is A, and there is no carry.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (C and 9). Since C in base-16 is equivalent to 12 in base-10, we have 12 + 9 = 21. In base-16, 21 is represented by the digits 1 and 5 (16 + 5). So, the leftmost digits of the sum are 15.\n\nPutting all the digits together, we get the sum C372 + 974D = 15ABF.\n\nSo, the result is \\boxed{15ABF}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

First, let's align the numbers vertically:\n\n  A946\n+ 5E98\n______\n\nNow, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column:\n\n6 + 8 = E\n\n4 + 9 = D\n\n9 + E = 17 (which is equal to 1*16^1 + 7 in base-16)\n\nA + 5 + 1 (carried from the previous column) = F\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n  A946\n+ 5E98\n______\n  FEDE\n\nThus, the sum of A946 and 5E98 is \\boxed{FEDE}.
