Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6 + 7)\nSince 6 + 7 = 15 in base-10, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 5. So, we have:\n\n  6346\n+1677\n------\n    5\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (4 + 7) and the carry-over (1)\n4 + 7 = 13 in base-10, and adding the carry-over, we get 14. Since 14 in base-8 is 16, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 6. So, we have:\n\n  6346\n+1677\n------\n   65\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (3 + 6) and the carry-over (1)\n3 + 6 = 11 in base-10, and adding the carry-over, we get 12. Since 12 in base-8 is 14, we need to carry over the 1 and write down the 4.

Since 10 in base-8 is 12, we write down the 12. So, we have:\n\n  6346\n+1677\n------\n 12465\n\nThus, the sum of 6346 and 1677 in base-8 is \\boxed{12465}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (7 and 2). Since 7+2 = 11 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 1 as the rightmost digit of the result. So far, we have:\n\n```\n  1707\n+ 3462\n------\n    01\n```\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (0 and 6) and the carry-over (1). Since 0+6+1 = 7 in base-10, there is no need to carry over any digit to the next column. Write down 7 as the next digit of the result:\n\n```\n  1707\n+ 3462\n------\n   701\n```\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (7 and 4). Since 7+4 = 11 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 1 as the next digit of the result:\n\n```\n  1707\n+ 3462\n------\n  1701\n```\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (1 and 3) and the carry-over (1). Since 1+3+1 = 5 in base-10, there is no need to carry over any digit. Write down 5 as the leftmost digit of the result:\n\n```\n  1707\n+ 3462\n------\n  51701\n```\n\nSo, 1707 + 3462 in base-8 is \\boxed{51701}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Adding the rightmost digits (4 + 6)\n4 + 6 = 12 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-8. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 2: Adding the next digits (2 + 5) and the carry-over (1)\n2 + 5 = 7 in base-10, and with the carry-over, 7 + 1 = 10 in base-10, which is equal to 10 in base-8. So, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.\n\nStep 3: Adding the next digits (1 + 3) and the carry-over (1)\n1 + 3 = 4 in base-10, and with the carry-over, 4 + 1 = 5 in base-10, which is equal to 5 in base-8. So, we write down 5 and there is no carry-over.\n\nStep 4: Adding the leftmost digits (4 + 5)\n4 + 5 = 11 in base-10, which is equal to 13 in base-8.

Since 5+0=5, we don't need to carry over any digits.\n\nStep 4: Add the leftmost digits (5 and 4). Since 5+4=11, we need to carry over 1 digit. In base-8, 11 is represented as 13 (1*8^1 + 3*8^0). So, we write down the 3 and carry over the 1.\n\nStep 5: Add the carried-over digit (1) to the result.\n\nSo, the final result is 13527. Therefore, 5515+4012 in base-8 is \\boxed{13527}.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (7 and 5).

Since 1+4+1=6 in base-10, there is no need to carry over any digit, and we write down 6 as the next digit of the sum.\n\nStep 4: Since there are no more digits in the first number, we just write down the remaining digit of the second number (4) as the leftmost digit of the sum.\n\nSo, the sum of 1147 and 4465 in base-8 is \\boxed{4614}.

So, the next digit of the sum is 5.\n\n3. In the next column, we have the digits 2 and 6. Adding them together, we get 10. However, since we are working in base-8, we need to carry over the 1 to the next column and keep the 0 as the current digit. So, the next digit of the sum is 0, and we carry over 1.\n\n4. In the leftmost column, we have the digits 5 and 2, plus the carry-over 1. Adding them together, we get 10. Again, since we are working in base-8, we need to carry over the 1 to a new column and keep the 0 as the current digit. So, the next digit of the sum is 0, and we carry over 1.\n\n5.

First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (3 + 5).\n3 + 5 = 10. Since we are in base-8, we carry over the 1 and write down the 0.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (4 + 5) and the carry-over (1).\n4 + 5 + 1 = 12.

Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	First, let's add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 1: Add the rightmost digits (6 + 7).\nSince 6 + 7 = 13 in base-10, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 3 as the rightmost digit of the result.\n\nStep 2: Add the next digits (5 + 6) and the carry-over (1).\n5 + 6 = 11 in base-10, and adding the carry-over gives 12 in base-10. Since 12 in base-8 is 14, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 4 as the next digit of the result.\n\nStep 3: Add the next digits (6 + 1) and the carry-over (1).\n6 + 1 = 7 in base-10, and adding the carry-over gives 10 in base-10. Since 10 in base-8 is 12, we need to carry over 1 to the next column and write down 2 as the next digit of the result.\n\nStep 4: Add the carry-over (1) to the leftmost digit.\nSince there are no more digits to add, we simply write down 1 as the leftmost digit of the result.\n\nSo, 6566 + 2167 in base-8 is \\boxed{12443}.
