We add the ones digits first. In base-8, 4+4=10. So the ones digit of the final sum is 0, and we need to carry over 1 to the next place. Then we add the tens digits, along with the carry-over. In base-8, 2+5+1=10. So the tens and ones digits of the final sum are 10. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{100}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 36+65? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}". We add the ones digits first. In base-8, 6+5=13. So the ones digit of the final sum is 3. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-8, 3+6=11. Since we carried over the 1, 11+1=12. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 12. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{123}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 55+16? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	We add the ones digits first. In base-8, 5+6=13. So the ones digit of the final sum is 3. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-8, 5+1=6. Since we carried over the 1, 6+1=7. So the tens digit of the final sum is 7. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{73}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
