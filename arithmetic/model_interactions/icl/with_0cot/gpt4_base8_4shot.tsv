Since we carried over the 1, 11+1=12. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 12. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{123}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 40+52? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}". We add the ones digits first. In base-8, 0+2=2. So the ones digit of the final sum is 2. We do not need to carry any digits over. Then we add the tens digits. In base-8, 4+5=11. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 11. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{112}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 26+70? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}". We add the ones digits first. In base-8, 6+0=6. So the ones digit of the final sum is 6. We do not need to carry any digits over. Then we add the tens digits. In base-8, 2+7=11. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 11. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{116}.\nYou are a mathematician.

Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is 55+16? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	We add the ones digits first. In base-8, 5+6=13. So the ones digit of the final sum is 3. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-8, 5+1=6. Since we carried over the 1, 6+1=7. So the tens digit of the final sum is 7. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{73}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
