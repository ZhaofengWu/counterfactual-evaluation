Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{129}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-10 where the digits are "0123456789", what is 91+19? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}". We add the ones digits first. In base-10, 1+9=10. So the ones digit of the final sum is 0. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-10, 9+1=10. Since we carried over the 1, 10+1=11. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 11. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{110}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-10 where the digits are "0123456789", what is 12+23? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}". We add the ones digits first. In base-10, 2+3=5. So the ones digit of the final sum is 5. We do not need to carry any digits over. Then we add the tens digits. In base-10, 1+2=3. So the tens digit of the final sum is 3. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{35}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-10 where the digits are "0123456789", what is 99+16? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}". We add the ones digits first. In base-10, 9+6=15. So the ones digit of the final sum is 5. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-10, 9+1=10. Since we carried over the 1, 10+1=11. So the hundreds and tens digits of the final sum are 11. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{115}.\nYou are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-10 where the digits are "0123456789", what is 48+23? Let's think step by step, and end the response with the result in "\\boxed{result}".	We add the ones digits first. In base-10, 8+3=11. So the ones digit of the final sum is 1. We need to carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then we add the tens digits. In base-10, 4+2=6. Since we carried over the 1, 6+1=7. So the tens digit of the final sum is 7. Putting the digits of the final sum together, we get \\boxed{71}.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
