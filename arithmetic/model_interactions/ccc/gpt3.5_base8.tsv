You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is the next number after 1330? Do this by counting the few preceding numbers and completing the sequence. End the response with the result.	The few preceding numbers in base-8 are: \n\n1327, 1328, 1329, 1330\n\nTo find the next number, we simply add 1 to the last digit (since we are in base-8). Therefore, the next number after 1330 is:\n\n1331	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1

You are a mathematician. Assuming that all numbers are in base-8 where the digits are "01234567", what is the next number after 1437? Do this by counting the few preceding numbers and completing the sequence. End the response with the result.	The few preceding numbers in base-8 are: \n\n1430, 1431, 1432, 1433, 1434, 1435, 1436 \n\nThe next number after 1437 in base-8 is: \n\n1440	False	gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	None	None	None	0	1
