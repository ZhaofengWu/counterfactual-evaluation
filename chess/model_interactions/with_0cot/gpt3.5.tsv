Nfe2 Nc5 - In traditional chess, this move is illegal because knights cannot move to the squares c5 or f2 on their second move. However, in the custom variant, knights and bishops have swapped starting positions, so Nfe2 is actually a bishop move to the square where the knight used to be. Similarly, Nc5 is a knight move to the square where the bishop used to be. Therefore, this move is legal in the custom variant.\n\nTherefore, the opening "1. e4 e6 2.

Ng3" is a legal move as the knight is on its starting square. "h5" is also a legal move as it is a valid pawn move. However, "2. Nf5" is an illegal move as the knight is now on a square where a bishop would normally be and cannot move to that square. Therefore, the opening "1. Ng3 h5 2.
