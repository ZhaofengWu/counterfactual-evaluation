Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate`, `scale`, and `translate`. Also, avoid defining any custom transformation functions yourself. Do not load any existing images. Do not draw the original objects. Please include as many details of the teddy bear as possible and put everything together in the end.
