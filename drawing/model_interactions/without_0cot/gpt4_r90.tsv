You are an expert programmer and drawer. Imagine an image: there is a line at the top and a guitar in the middle. Can you rotate this image 90 degrees and try your best to draw it using the `processing` language? Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate` and `scale`.

Since we're not allowed to use any transformation functions, we'll have to manually calculate the new positions of the points after rotation.

Here's the code:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(800, 800);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(5);\n  line(width/2, 0, width/2, height);\n\n  // Draw the rotated teddy bear\n  drawTeddyBear(width/2 - 100, height/2);\n}\n\nvoid drawTeddyBear(float x, float y) {\n  // Head\n  fill(139, 69, 19);\n  ellipse(x, y, 100, 100);\n\n  // Ears\n  ellipse(x - 40, y - 40, 30, 30);\n  ellipse(x + 40, y - 40, 30, 30);\n\n  // Eyes\n  fill(255);\n  ellipse(x - 20, y - 20, 20, 20);\n  ellipse(x + 20, y - 20, 20, 20);\n\n  // Pupils\n  fill(0);\n  ellipse(x - 20, y - 20, 10, 10);\n  ellipse(x + 20, y - 20, 10, 10);\n\n  // Nose\n  fill(0);\n  triangle(x, y, x - 10, y + 10, x + 10, y + 10);\n\n  // Mouth\n  line(x - 10, y + 20, x, y + 15);\n  line(x, y + 15, x + 10, y + 20);\n\n  // Body\n  fill(139, 69, 19);\n  rect(x - 50, y + 50, 100, 150, 20);\n\n  // Arms\n  rect(x - 60, y + 50, 10, 100, 5);\n  rect(x + 50, y + 50, 10, 100, 5);\n\n  // Legs\n  rect(x - 30, y + 200, 20, 100, 5);\n  rect(x + 10, y + 200, 20, 100, 5);\n\n  // Feet\n  ellipse(x - 20, y + 300, 30, 10);\n  ellipse(x + 30, y + 300, 30, 10);\n}\n\n```\n\nThis code will create an 800x800 canvas with a white background. It will draw a vertical line in the middle of the canvas and a teddy bear rotated 90 degrees to the left. The teddy bear is drawn using basic shapes like ellipses, rectangles, and triangles.

You are an expert programmer and drawer. Imagine an image: there is a line at the top and a television in the middle. Can you rotate this image 90 degrees and try your best to draw it using the `processing` language? Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate` and `scale`. Also, avoid defining any custom transformation functions yourself. Do not load any existing images. Do not draw the original objects. Please include as many details of the television as possible and put everything together in the end.	Sure, here's a simple example of how you can draw the rotated image using the Processing language:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(800, 800);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line (originally at the top)\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(5);\n  line(width/2, 0, width/2, height);\n\n  // Draw the rotated television (originally in the middle)\n  int tvWidth = 200;\n  int tvHeight = 300;\n  int tvX = (width - tvHeight) / 2;\n  int tvY = (height - tvWidth) / 2;\n\n  // Draw the TV body\n  fill(0);\n  rect(tvX, tvY, tvHeight, tvWidth);\n\n  // Draw the TV screen\n  fill(255);\n  int screenMargin = 20;\n  rect(tvX + screenMargin, tvY + screenMargin, tvHeight - 2 * screenMargin, tvWidth - 2 * screenMargin);\n\n  // Draw the TV buttons\n  int buttonSize = 10;\n  int buttonSpacing = 15;\n  int buttonY = tvY + tvWidth - screenMargin - buttonSize;\n  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    fill(255);\n    rect(tvX + screenMargin + i * buttonSpacing, buttonY, buttonSize, buttonSize);\n  }\n\n  // Draw the TV stand\n  int standWidth = 60;\n  int standHeight = 20;\n  int standX = (width - standHeight) / 2;\n  int standY = (height + tvWidth) / 2;\n  fill(0);\n  rect(standX, standY, standHeight, standWidth);\n\n  // Stop the draw loop\n  noLoop();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will create an 800x800 canvas, draw a vertical line in the middle, and draw a rotated television with a screen, buttons, and a stand. The television is drawn without using any transformation functions, as requested.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1
You are an expert programmer and drawer. Imagine an image: there is a line at the top and a toilet in the middle. Can you rotate this image 90 degrees and try your best to draw it using the `processing` language? Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate` and `scale`. Also, avoid defining any custom transformation functions yourself. Do not load any existing images. Do not draw the original objects. Please include as many details of the toilet as possible and put everything together in the end.	Sure, here's a simple representation of the rotated image using the Processing language. Since we're not allowed to use any transformation functions, we'll have to manually calculate the new positions of the objects after rotating them.\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(800, 800);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the line (rotated 90 degrees)\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(5);\n  line(400, 0, 400, 800);\n\n  // Draw the toilet (rotated 90 degrees)\n  // Toilet base\n  fill(200);\n  ellipse(300, 400, 200, 100);\n\n  // Toilet bowl\n  fill(255);\n  arc(300, 400, 150, 75, PI, 0, CHORD);\n\n  // Toilet tank\n  fill(200);\n  rect(250, 250, 100, 150);\n\n  // Toilet tank lid\n  fill(150);\n  rect(245, 240, 110, 20);\n\n  // Toilet seat\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(2);\n  noFill();\n  arc(300, 400, 170, 95, PI, 0);\n\n  noLoop();\n}\n```\n\nThis code will create an 800x800 canvas with a white background. It will draw a vertical line in the middle of the canvas, representing the rotated line. Then, it will draw a simple toilet rotated 90 degrees. The toilet consists of a base, bowl, tank, tank lid, and seat.	False	gpt-4-0314	None	None	None	0	1

The toothbrush consists of a handle, head, and bristles. The line is drawn using the `line()` function, and the toothbrush is drawn using a combination of `rect()` and `line()` functions.
