Draw the line at the top (height) of the canvas \n2. Draw the fountain from top to bottom:\n   - The base (largest ellipse)\n   - The lower bowl \n   - The upper bowl\n   - The spout (two lines)\n3. Draw random blue circles to represent the water droplets\n\nBy drawing the objects from top to bottom, I achieved the 180-degree rotation effect without using any built-in transformation functions.

So the head is drawn at `(width - 65, height - 95)` instead of `(65, 95)`, the ears are drawn at `(width - 90, height - 95)` and `(width - 40, height - 95)` instead of `(90, 95)` and `(40, 95)`, and so on.\n\nHope this helps demonstrate how to draw rotated objects without using built-in transformation functions!

For example, to draw the rotated line, we calculate the y-coordinate of the original line and then draw the line at the bottom. To draw the rotated knife, we calculate the coordinates of the original handle, blade, and bolster and then draw them at the opposite side. Let me know if you have any questions!

The battery has an outline, two end caps, a body, and two terminals.

Here is my attempt at drawing a 180-degree rotated line and hammer in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line \n  int lineY = height;  // The y-coordinate of the original line\n  line(0, lineY, width, lineY);  // Draw the rotated line at the bottom\n  \n  // Draw the rotated hammer\n  // Handle \n  int handleWidth = 30;\n  int handleHeight = 100;\n  int handleX = width/2 - handleWidth/2;\n  int handleY = height - handleHeight;\n  rect(handleX, handleY, handleWidth, handleHeight);\n  \n  // Head \n  int headWidth = 70;\n  int headHeight = 30;\n  int headX = width/2 - headWidth/2;\n  int headY = handleY - headHeight;\n  rect(headX, headY, headWidth, headHeight);\n  \n  // Claw 1\n  int claw1Width = 30;\n  int claw1Height = 20;\n  int claw1X = headX;\n  int claw1Y = headY - claw1Height;\n  rect(claw1X, claw1Y, claw1Width, claw1Height);\n  \n  // Claw 2\n  int claw2X = headX + headWidth - claw1Width;\n  rect(claw2X, claw1Y, claw1Width, claw1Height); \n}\n```\n\nThe key idea is to draw the rotated line and hammer at the bottom and right side of the canvas, respectively, by calculating the coordinates based on the width and height of the canvas. I tried to include as many details of the hammer as possible by drawing the handle, head, and two claws. Let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification!

It then draws the key by mirroring the original key across the y-axis. The key head is an ellipse, with two sets of teeth drawn as quads. The key shaft is a rectangle, with an arc representing the bow. Finally, the key wards (the bumps on the key) are drawn as ellipses.

Here is my attempt at drawing a 180-degree rotated line and shopping cart in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line \n  int x1 = width; \n  int y1 = 0;\n  int x2 = width;\n  int y2 = height;\n  line(x1, y1, x2, y2);\n  \n  // Draw the rotated shopping cart\n  // Wheels\n  ellipse(width - 30, 30, 20, 20);\n  ellipse(width - 30, height - 50, 20, 20);\n  \n  // Cart base\n  rect(width - 100, 50, 80, 30);\n  \n  // Handle\n  line(width - 80, 50, width - 130, 80);\n  \n  // Items in the cart\n  ellipse(width - 50, 70, 10, 10); // Apples\n  rect(width - 70, 60, 10, 20);   // Box\n  triangle(width - 90, 65, width - 85, 70, width - 95, 70); // Carrot\n  \n  // Shadows\n  noStroke();\n  fill(100);\n  ellipse(width - 30, 30, 30, 10);\n  ellipse(width - 30, height - 50, 30, 10);\n  quad(width - 100, 50, width - 100, 80, width - 130, 80, width - 130, 50);\n}\n```\n\nThis draws a line at the bottom of the canvas and a detailed shopping cart at the top right, achieving the 180-degree rotation effect without using any built-in transformation functions in Processing.

You are an expert programmer and drawer. Imagine an image: there is a line at the top and a toilet in the middle.

To rotate an object 180 degrees, I need to draw it on the opposite side of the canvas. So I draw the line at (width, 0) and (width, height) which is the top of the canvas.\n\n2. For the toilet, I break it down into multiple parts: tank, toilet seat, toilet bowl, water, and base. \n\n3. I draw each part at the opposite side. For example, the tank is drawn at (width - 50, height - 150) which is 50 pixels from the right and 150 pixels from the bottom. \n\n4. For the curved toilet bowl, I use the `arc()` function to draw a semi-circle at the opposite side. \n\n5. For the water in the bowl, I use `quad()` to draw a quadrilateral shape.\n\n6. I put all the parts together to form a complete 180-degree rotated toilet.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need any clarification! I'm happy to explain my thinking process in more detail.
