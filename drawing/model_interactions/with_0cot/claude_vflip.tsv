Here is my attempt at drawing a vertically flipped line and plunger in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the vertically flipped line \n  int lineY = height;  // Start from the bottom of the canvas\n  line(0, lineY, width, lineY);  // Draw a horizontal line\n  \n  // Draw the vertically flipped plunger\n  // Handle\n  int handleWidth = 30;\n  int handleHeight = 10;\n  int handleX = width/2 - handleWidth/2;\n  int handleY = height - handleHeight;\n  rect(handleX, handleY, handleWidth, handleHeight);\n  \n  // Plunger cup\n  int cupDiameter = 50;\n  int cupX = width/2 - cupDiameter/2;\n  int cupY = handleY - cupDiameter;\n  ellipse(cupX, cupY, cupDiameter, cupDiameter);\n  \n  // Plunger rod\n  int rodWidth = 10;\n  int rodHeight = height - handleHeight - cupDiameter;\n  int rodX = width/2 - rodWidth/2;\n  int rodY = cupY - rodHeight;\n  rect(rodX, rodY, rodWidth, rodHeight);\n  \n  // Add plunger seal\n  int sealDiameter = cupDiameter - 10;\n  int sealX = cupX + 5;\n  int sealY = cupY + 5;\n  ellipse(sealX, sealY, sealDiameter, sealDiameter);\n}\n```\n\nThis draws the vertically flipped line at the bottom of the canvas by using the height variable. It then draws the plunger components from bottom to top, including the handle, cup, rod, and seal. By thinking step by step and using the height variable, I was able to draw the vertically flipped image without using any built-in transformation functions.
