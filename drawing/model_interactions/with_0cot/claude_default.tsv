You are an expert programmer and drawer. Imagine an image: there is a line at the top and a teddy bear in the middle. Can you try your best to draw the line and the teddy bear using the `processing` language? Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate`, `scale`, and `translate`. Also, avoid defining any custom transformation functions yourself. Do not load any existing images. Please include as many details of the teddy bear as possible and put everything together in the end. Let's think step by step.	Here is my attempt at drawing a line and a teddy bear in Processing without using any transformations:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(3);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the line at the top\n  line(0, 0, width, 0);\n  \n  // Draw the head\n  fill(255, 255, 255);\n  ellipse(200, 150, 100, 100);\n  \n  // Draw the ears\n  triangle(150, 100, 200, 150, 250, 100);\n  triangle(150, 150, 200, 200, 250, 150);\n  \n  // Draw the eyes\n  fill(0, 0, 0);\n  ellipse(175, 125, 20, 20);\n  ellipse(225, 125, 20, 20);\n  \n  // Draw the nose\n  fill(255, 0, 0);\n  ellipse(200, 140, 10, 10);\n  \n  // Draw the body\n  fill(255, 255, 255);\n  rect(150, 200, 100, 100);\n  \n  // Draw the arms\n  line(150, 250, 100, 300);\n  line(250, 250, 300, 300);\n  \n  // Draw the legs\n  line(150, 300, 100, 350);\n  line(250, 300, 300, 350);\n  \n  // Add details to the arms and legs\n  fill(0, 0, 0);\n  ellipse(125, 325, 10, 10);\n  ellipse(275, 325, 10, 10);\n  ellipse(125, 375, 10, 10);\n  ellipse(275, 375, 10, 10);\n}\n```\n\nThis draws a line at the top, then proceeds to draw the different parts of the teddy bear including the head, ears, eyes, nose, body, arms, legs, and some details.
