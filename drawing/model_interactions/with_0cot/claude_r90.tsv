Here is my attempt at rotating the image 90 degrees clockwise without using any built-in transformation functions in Processing:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the line at the top\n  line(0, 0, width, 0);\n  \n  // Draw the bear in the middle\n  // Head\n  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);\n  \n  // Ears\n  triangle(width/2 - 50, height/2 - 50, width/2 - 10, height/2 - 90, width/2 + 30, height/2 - 50);\n  triangle(width/2 + 50, height/2 - 50, width/2 + 10, height/2 - 90, width/2 - 30, height/2 - 50);\n  \n  // Eyes\n  ellipse(width/2 - 30, height/2 - 30, 20, 20);\n  ellipse(width/2 + 30, height/2 - 30, 20, 20);\n  \n  // Nose\n  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 10, 10);\n  \n  // Body\n  rect(width/2 - 50, height/2 + 30, 100, 100);\n  \n  // Arms\n  line(width/2 - 70, height/2 + 50, width/2 - 130, height/2 + 100);\n  line(width/2 + 70, height/2 + 50, width/2 + 130, height/2 + 100);\n  \n  // Legs\n  line(width/2 - 30, height/2 + 130, width/2 - 30, height/2 + 180);\n  line(width/2 + 30, height/2 + 130, width/2 + 30, height/2 + 180);\n}\n```\n\nTo rotate this 90 degrees clockwise without using any built-in transformation functions, I would do the following:\n\n1. Draw the line at the left instead of the top. So `line(0, 0, 0, height);`\n\n2. For the bear:\n   - Draw the head as an ellipse at `(height/2, width/2)` with the same size.\n   - Draw the ears as triangles with the x and y coordinates swapped. \n   - Draw the eyes as ellipses at `(height/2 - 30, width/2 - 30)` and `(height/2 + 30, width/2 - 30)`.\n   - Draw the nose as an ellipse at `(height/2, width/2)`.\n   - Draw the body as a rectangle at `(height/2 - 50, width/2 + 30)` with the width and height swapped.\n   - Draw the arms as lines with the x and y coordinates swapped.\n   - Draw the legs as lines with the x and y coordinates swapped.\n\n3. Put everything together to get the full rotated image.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to provide the full rotated code. I can also explain my thinking process in more detail if needed.

Here is my attempt at drawing the 90-degree rotated line and battery in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(2);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line \n  line(width, 0, width, height);\n  \n  // Draw the rotated battery\n  // Top rectangle\n  rect(width - 65, 25, 60, 110);\n  \n  // Bottom rectangle\n  rect(width - 65, 145, 60, 60);\n  \n  // Left circle\n  ellipse(width - 30, 90, 25, 25);\n  \n  // Right circle \n  ellipse(width - 100, 90, 25, 25);\n  \n  // Plus sign\n  line(width - 65, 90, width - 35, 90);\n  line(width - 65, 120, width - 35, 120);\n  \n  // Minus sign\n  line(width - 100, 115, width - 30, 115);\n}\n```\n\nMy thinking process:\n\n1. To rotate an object 90 degrees, I need to draw it along the y-axis instead of the x-axis. So I will draw the line and battery with `y` coordinates instead of `x` coordinates.\n\n2. For the line, I simply need to draw a vertical line at the right edge of the canvas using `line(width, 0, width, height);`\n\n3. For the battery, I break it down into multiple parts:\n\n- Top rectangle: `rect(width - 65, 25, 60, 110);` \n- Bottom rectangle: `rect(width - 65, 145, 60, 60);`\n- Left circle: `ellipse(width - 30, 90, 25, 25);`\n- Right circle: `ellipse(width - 100, 90, 25, 25);`\n- Plus sign: `line(width - 65, 90, width - 35, 90);` and `line(width - 65, 120, width - 35, 120);`\n- Minus sign: `line(width - 100, 115, width - 30, 115);`\n\n4.

Can you rotate this image 90 degrees and try your best to draw the 90-degree rotated line and the 90-degree rotated key using the `processing` language? Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate`, `scale`, and `translate`. Also, avoid defining any custom transformation functions yourself. Do not load any existing images. Do not draw the original objects. Please include as many details of the key as possible and put everything together in the end. Let's think step by step.	Here is my attempt at drawing the rotated line and key in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  stroke(0);\n  strokeWeight(3);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line\n  line(width, 0, width, height);\n  \n  // Draw the rotated key\n  // Handle\n  line(width/2, height/4, width/2, height/2);\n  \n  // Teeth\n  line(width/2 - 10, height/2, width/2 + 10, height/2);\n  line(width/2 - 5, height/2 + 5, width/2 + 5, height/2 + 5);\n  line(width/2 - 15, height/2 + 10, width/2 + 15, height/2 + 10);\n  \n  // Blade\n  line(width/2, height/2, width/2, height*3/4);\n  \n  // Teeth details\n  ellipse(width/2 - 10, height/2, 5, 5);\n  ellipse(width/2 + 10, height/2, 5, 5);\n  ellipse(width/2 - 5, height/2 + 5, 3, 3);\n  ellipse(width/2 + 5, height/2 + 5, 3, 3);\n  ellipse(width/2 - 15, height/2 + 10, 3, 3);\n  ellipse(width/2 + 15, height/2 + 10, 3, 3);\n  \n  // Key ring\n  ellipse(width/2, height*3/4, 20, 20);\n}\n```\n\nTo draw the rotated line, I simply drew a vertical line at the width of the canvas. \nTo draw the rotated key, I broke it down into multiple steps:\n\n1. Draw the handle as a vertical line\n2. Draw the teeth of the key \n3. Draw the blade of the key\n4. Add details to the teeth by drawing ellipses\n5. Draw the key ring at the bottom\n\nBy putting all these steps together, I was able to draw the rotated key without using any built-in transformation functions.

To draw each part after rotation, I use the width and height variables to represent the new x and y coordinates respectively. The bulb base is an ellipse at (width, height/2). The neck is a rectangle from (width - 25, height/2 - 50) to (width, height/2). The filament holder is an ellipse at (width - 25, height/2 - 50). The filament consists of 3 lines with varying (x, y) coordinates. Finally, the bulb glass is an ellipse at (width, height/2) with a larger size.\n\nHope this helps demonstrate how to draw rotated objects without using any built-in transformation functions!

Please do not use any built-in transformation functions, such as `rotate`, `scale`, and `translate`. Also, avoid defining any custom transformation functions yourself. Do not load any existing images. Do not draw the original objects. Please include as many details of the teddy bear as possible and put everything together in the end. Let's think step by step.	Here is my attempt at drawing a 90-degree rotated line and teddy bear in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions:\n\n```processing\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  // Draw the rotated line\n  line(width, 0, width, height);\n  \n  // Draw the rotated teddy bear\n  // Head\n  ellipse(width - 50, 50, 100, 100);\n  \n  // Ears\n  triangle(width - 50, 50, width - 100, 100, width, 50);\n  triangle(width, 50, width - 100, 100, width + 50, 50);\n  \n  // Eyes\n  ellipse(width - 75, 75, 20, 20);\n  ellipse(width - 25, 75, 20, 20);\n  \n  // Nose\n  ellipse(width - 50, 100, 10, 10);\n  \n  // Body\n  rect(width - 100, 150, 200, 150);\n  \n  // Arms\n  line(width - 150, 200, width - 250, 250);\n  line(width - 50, 200, width + 50, 250);\n  \n  // Legs\n  line(width - 100, 300, width - 150, 400);\n  line(width, 300, width - 50, 400);\n}\n```\n\nTo draw the rotated line, I simply drew a vertical line at the width (right edge) of the canvas. \nTo draw the rotated teddy bear, I imagined how each part (head, ears, eyes, nose, body, arms, legs) would look like if rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Then I drew each part at the appropriate (x, y) coordinates. For example, the head ellipse is drawn at (width - 50, 50) with a width of 100 and height of 100. The ears are two triangles with vertices at (width - 50, 50), (width - 100, 100), (width, 50) and (width, 50),  (width - 100, 100), (width + 50, 50) respectively.\n\nI tried to include as many details as possible for the teddy bear. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the code. I'd be happy to walk through it step by step.	False	claude-v1.3	None	None	None	0	1

You are an expert programmer and drawer. Imagine an image: there is a line at the top and a toilet in the middle.

The original line is at the top, so the rotated line should be at the right, connecting the top-right and bottom-right corners. I drew this with `line(width, 0, width, height)`.\n\n2. The original toilet tank is on the top, so the rotated tank should be on the right. I drew this with `rect(width - 50, 30, 50, 20)`.\n\n3. The original toilet seat is a semi-circle on top, so the rotated seat should be a semi-circle on the right. I drew this with `arc(width - 65, 50, 30, 30, 0, PI)`.\n\n4. The original toilet bowl is a semi-circle at the bottom, so the rotated bowl should be a semi-circle on the right. I drew this with `arc(width - 65, 80, 30, 30, PI, TWO_PI)`.\n\n5. The original rectangular toilet base is at the bottom, so the rotated base should be on the right. I drew this with `rect(width - 65, 190, 30, 10)`. \n\n6. I added some details like the water in the toilet bowl with `quad`.\n\n7. I put all the shapes together by positioning them properly relative to each other.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of my answer. I hope this helps!

A vertical line in the middle (the rotated original top line)\n2. A rectangle for the toothbrush handle at the bottom \n3. Multiple lines for the toothbrush bristles \n4. A rectangle for the toothbrush head above the handle\n\nBy putting all these elements together, this attempts to draw a 90-degree rotated line and toothbrush image in Processing without using any built-in transformation functions.
